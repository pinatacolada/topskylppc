\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Disclaimer}
Although - as its name suggests - the plugin is based on TOPLIS and the TopSky ATM system, it is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Thales Group or NAV Portugal. Similarities between plugin features and the real system are not entirely coincidental, but the plugin can not be used as a real world training aid. ~\cite{git}\\

\section{Foreword}
EuroScope, a controller client developed by Gergely Csernák for the VATSIM network, was first released for public use in September 2007. One of the biggest changes in version 3.1 was the possibility for the user community to customize the program to an even higher degree than was possible before by writing their own plugins that can be used to alter the way information is presented and even create completely new functionality into the program. This allowed creating very detailed simulations of all kinds of ATC systems without making the main program overly complex. Version 3.2 expands on these possibilities, making it possible to create even better plugins.
The TopSky plugin (a.k.a. The Plugin Formerly Known As “EUROCAT 2000 E”) started out as a very small project to create a couple of customized aircraft tag items, but as more information about the real system and the possibilities with the plugin development became available, it slowly grew to include an almost complete set of tag items, tag menus, graphical elements on the radar display and some additional functionality.

\chapter{System Description}
\section{Main Window}
\includegraphics[width=15cm, keepaspectratio]{img/mainwindow.png}\\
Euroscope should load with some preplaced windows similar to the above configuration\\

Screen resolutions other than 1920x1080 will yield different results. Larger resolutions will bring preplaced windows towards the left and middle, while smaller resolutions may potentially place windows outside the screen. It is recommended for users experiencing difficulties related to their screen size to experiment and create custom settings in the TopSkySettingsLocal file containing revised window placements adjusted for their own screen. Refer to \texttt{\detokenize{TopSky_Developer_Guide_Settings.xlsx}} for available settings.\\

\section{Global Menu}
\includegraphics{img/globalmenu.png}\\
The Global Menu is located on the top edge of the radar screen. It displays the current UTC time and contains a number of submenus which are explained below.

\subsection{Setup Menu}
\includegraphics{img/Setup.png}\\
Setup Menu allows for various adjustments. Each position will load its defined settings based on the active Primary Frequency.\\ 
Most used options are CPDLC Setting for CPDLC operations and Default Setting to reset options.\\

\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}p{10cm}}

  \end{tabular}

\subsection*{Unit Settings submenu}
This submenu can be used to change the units used in the plugin. Any changes to the settings are session-
specific only, so they will be lost when exiting EuroScope.

\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}p{10cm}}
    \\- Altitude & Selects the units used for altitudes and vertical rates
    - Nautical (feet, feet per minute)
    - Metric (meters, meters per second)
    \\- Flight level & Selects the units for flight levels – only applicable with metric altitudes
    - Nautical (hundreds of feet)
    - Metric (meters)
    \\- Distance & Selects the units used for distances
    - Nautical (nautical miles)
    - Metric (kilometers)
    \\- Speed & Selects the units used for speeds
    - Nautical (knots)
    - Metric (kilometers per hour)
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Local Settings submenu}
This submenu allows changing some of the plugin’s settings. Any changes to the settings are session-
specific only, so they will be lost when exiting EuroScope.

\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}p{10cm}}
\\- Vertical reference    & Selects the pressure reference to be used at or below the
transition altitude:
• QNH Altitude above mean sea level
• QFE Height above the aerodrome elevation
(set/check it in the adjacent box)
\\- Used equipment codes  & Selects whether to use or disregard the equipment codes
found in the flight plans:
• All Use all codes
• ICAO Use all codes when specified in ICAO format
• ICAO-alt As ICAO, but force transponder to report altitude
• None Disregard all codes

\\- ASSR codes    & Selects the transponder code source:
• Plugin Plugin data file (reverts to ESE if no codes found)
• ESE ESE file
• Range Fixed code range
\\- Groundspeed   & Selects whether to use pilot client reported ground speed or a
plugin calculated value. Normally the reported value should be
used as it is more accurate and stable, but some clients report
wrong values. If that causes problems, you can try selecting the
plugin calculated value instead
\\- Transfer confirmation & Selects when to display the Transfer Confirmation Window:
• On Always when CFL is not equal to XFL
• NotRFL When CFL is not equal to XFL unless XFL = RFL
• Off Never, any CFL value is OK
\\- CFL menu default value    & Selects the default value for the CFL menu when it is opened:
• XFL FSS or CTR: RFL if not yet reached, otherwise as below
Other: The XFL value, or current CFL value with no XFL
• CFL The current CFL value
• RFL The RFL value
\\- FPCP inhibit  & FPCP calculations start when tracks are within this time from
entering active sector
\\- STCA alert    & Selects which aircraft display the STCA alert:
• All All aircraft
• Own+Co Only assumed and coordinated aircraft
• Own Only assumed aircraft
\\- STCA alert sound  & Selects which STCA alerts trigger the alert sound:
• All All alerts
• Own+Co Only alerts with assumed and/or coordinated
aircraft involved
• Own Only alerts with assumed aircraft involved
\\- APW alert & Selects which aircraft display the APW alert:
• All All aircraft
• Own+Co Only assumed and coordinated aircraft

\end{tabular}\\

When enabled, the list options bar displays “Info Conc Redu Filter Filter” on the right edge of the Global
Menu. The first three toggle the respective settings for the Sector List and are colored with the appropriate
color when enabled, and the last two are displayed in “VFR” color when the corresponding
Uncontrolled list is somehow filtered. Clicking on them opens the Flight Plan Lists submenu to change
the filtering options.\\
Left-clicking <filter> cycles through “ALL” (no filtering), “ON-CONTACT” (only tracks on-contact with
anyone), “ON-CONTACT-PPOS” (only tracks on-contact with you) and “FREE” (only tracks in the free state).\\
Left-clicking <units> opens a text entry box to enter a comma-separated list of aerodrome ICAO codes to
filter the list. When entered, the list will display a flight only if one of the entered codes is its departure or
destination, or the code is found in its scratchpad (OP-TEXT2).\\

Left-clicking <lfunc>, <adep>, <ades> and <via> open text entry boxes to enter comma-separated lists for
controlled ID’s, ICAO codes and point names respectively to filter the affected lists.\\
Left-clicking <state> toggles between “ALL” (no filtering), “SIMUL+TERM” (not started flight plans filtered),
“NOTST+SIMUL” (terminated flight plans filtered) and “SIMUL” (not started and terminated flight plans
filtered).\\

\\- RWY line display…              & Opens the \textit{\titleref{menu:ad}}
\end{tabular}\\

\subsection*{Plugin Status submenu}
Shows the version of the plugin as well as some information on the loaded data files. Each data file reports
its state with one of the following indicators:\\
\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}p{10cm}}
- OK        & File contains usable information and no faults
\\- NO DATA   & File not found or contains no usable information
\\- BAD DATA  & File contains invalid data (in “Warning” color)
\end{tabular}\\
Depending on the file, there are one to three of the following buttons available:\\
\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}p{10cm}}
- Reload                    & Reloads the data file
\\- View                    & Displays the data in the file on the radar display
\\- Save (Areas)            & Saves a snapshot of the current area activation data
\\- Save set (Maps \& MapsL) & Saves a list of currently active radar screen specific maps
\\- Load set (Maps \& MapsL) & Loads a saved list of active screen specific maps
\end{tabular}\\ 

Left-clicking the Save button will save the currently set manual activation periods as well as the
information if an area with automatic schedules is set to manual mode. The information is saved to the
“TopSkyAreasManualAct.txt” file in the same folder as the plugin dll. If the file already exists, the plugin will
ask for confirmation as the save operation will overwrite any existing data.\\
Depending on the maps data file setup, the display state of some or all of the maps may be specific to each
radar screen. The Save set and Load set functions can be used to transfer the display state of these maps
from one radar screen to another.\\
Right-clicking the Reload button for Settings \& SettingsL has a special purpose. It opens a text entry box to
type in a callsign whose settings should be loaded instead of the real login callsign. When entered, the
callsign will be displayed next to the “Reload” button, and whenever a VATSIM callsign change is detected,
an information popup is displayed to remind that the plugin settings are still forced to the manually
entered callsign. This feature can be used for example to use settings for different positions on different
EuroScope instances when providing top-down services, or to use settings for a specific position when
logged in with an observer/staff/supervisor callsign. Clearing the entered callsign reverts to using the
settings based on the actual login callsign.\\

\subsection*{Supervisory submenu}
\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}p{10cm}}
- Operations Rate...     & Opens the \textit{\titleref{win:or}}
\\- Predicted Traffic... & Opens the \textit{\titleref{win:pt}}
\end{tabular}\\ 

\subsection{RRxxx/Off}
Opens the \textit{\titleref{menu:rr}}. If the rings are selected on,
“xxx” displays the distance between consecutive rings, otherwise “Off”.

\subsection{Mxxx-yyy}
Displays the status of the filters. If any filter is enabled and Quick Look is not toggled on, the color of the
text is “Global Menu Highlight”.\\
Only the altitude filter status is shown. “xxx” displays the Lower filter value and “yyy” the Upper filter
value, in hundreds of feet.\\

\subsection{S000-999}
Not implemented (shows static values).\\

\section{Track Presentation}
The presentation of tracks consists of the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Aircraft position symbol}
\item{History dots}
\item{Prediction line}
\item{Track label, joined to the position symbol with a leader line}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Colors}
Most of the track presentation coloring depends on the flight sector state.
\\For controlled flights (any IFR flight or a VFR flight in ASSUMED state), the colors are as follows:\\
\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}p{5cm}p{5cm}}
\textbf{State}          & \textbf{Color}    & \textbf{Condition}
\\Unconcerned           & “Unconcerned”     & Track will not enter the active sector
\\Notified              & “Concerned”       & Track will enter the active sector (> 15 min)
\\Coordinated           & “Coordination”    & Track will enter the active sector (< 15 min)
\\Assumed               & “Assumed”         & Track is assumed
\\Transfer Initiated    & “Assumed”         & Track is being transferred to the next controller
\\Redundant             & “Redundant”       & Track has been transferred to the next controller but is still inside the active sector
\end{tabular}\\

An unconcerned track can be highlighted based on rules (a combination of departure airport, route and
arrival airport) defined in plugin data files. In this case it is drawn with one of the three “Informed” colors.\\

Coordinated tracks that have not departed yet will be shown as notified instead.\\

For uncontrolled flights (VFR flights not in ASSUMED state), the colors are as follows:\\
\begin{tabular}{p{5cm}p{5cm}p{5cm}}
\textbf{State}  & \textbf{Color}    & \textbf{Condition}
\\On Contact    & “Assumed”         & Track is on-contact (a plugin custom state) with you
\\Free          & “VFR”             & Track is not assumed or on-contact with anyone
\\Otherwise     & “Unconcerned”     &
\end{tabular}\\

\section{Track Label Menus}

\section{Flight Leg}

\section{Windows}

\subsection{Airspace Management Window}
\label{menu:tsa}
\includegraphics{img/tsa.png}\\
This window is used for the activation and deactivation of the areas for the APW and SAP functionality. Each area can have a start time and/or an end time defined for its activation, or it can be activated without any time limits, making it active until deactivated manually. Additionally, lower and upper altitude limits are given. An area can have activation schedules defined in the area data file. Such areas will be automatically activated as long as their “Auto” option is selected ( “A” in the “Auto” column). The “Auto” option cannot be selected for areas that don’t have an activation schedule defined in the area data file.

Dates will be shown in the format “yymmdd” and times in “hh:mm” and they must be entered in the same format. Entering an empty string for a date will clear it and the related time value and vice versa. When entering a time or date value to an empty field, the other value is automatically set to the current time/date value. Entering an empty string to the Map Text, Lower or Upper fields will reset the value to the default one from the data file.

Altitudes are shown in hundreds of feet if at or below the transition altitude, otherwise in flight levels. They must be entered in the same format.

An area’s activation status can be inactive, pre-active or active. A pre-active area is an area that will become active within 30 minutes and is shown in yellow text on a gray background. An active area is shown with yellow text on a blue background. The APW system will not alert for a pre-active area, but for the SAP system a pre-active area is considered as being active.
