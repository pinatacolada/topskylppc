\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Disclaimer}

Although - as its name suggests - the TopSky plugin is based on TOPLIS and the TopSky ATM system, it is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by Thales Group or NAV Portugal. Similarities between plugin features and the real system are not entirely coincidental, but the plugin can not be used as a real world training aid.

\section{Foreword}

EuroScope, a controller client developed by Gergely Csernák for the VATSIM network, was first released for public use in September 2007. One of the biggest changes in version 3.1 was the possibility for the user community to customize the program to an even higher degree than was possible before by writing their own plugins that can be used to alter the way information is presented and even create completely new functionality into the program. This allowed creating very detailed simulations of all kinds of ATC systems without making the main program overly complex. Version 3.2 expands on these possibilities, making it possible to create even better plugins.

\bigskip

The base TopSky plugin is developed by Juha Holopainen. The TopSky plugin (a.k.a. The Plugin Formerly Known As “EUROCAT 2000 E”) started out as a very small project to create a couple of customized aircraft tag items, but as more information about the real system and the possibilities with the plugin development became available, it slowly grew to include an almost complete set of tag items, tag menus, graphical elements on the radar display and some additional functionality.\cite{topskygen}

\bigskip

The A-CDM plugin is developed by Roger Puig. CDM is an Euroscope plugin based on the real life CDM tool that allows us to improve the departure flows at airports.\cite{cdm}

\chapter{Systems}

\section{A-CDM}

Airport CDM (A-CDM) aims to improve the efficiency and resilience of airport operations by optimising the use of resources and improving the predictability of air traffic. 

It also allows the exchange of more accurate departure information, particularly target take-off times, with the European ATFCM network, leading to improved en-route and sectoral planning.\cite{eurocontrol}

\subsection{Operation}

The A-CDM plugin operates in a Master-Slave topology, in which the "CDM Master" will calculate the required data and distribute it to the slaved CDM positions. Due to this, it is mandatory that the "Master" ATC is the one at the lowest position, such as Delivery.

\warn{IF THERE IS NO ACTIVE "CDM MASTER" A-CDM WILL NOT BE OPERATIONAL}

\warn{IF MORE THAN ONE POSITION ASSIGNS ITSELF AS "CDM MASTER" A-CDM WILL NOT BE OPERATIONAL}

At the end of a session or controller swap, the "CDM MASTER" ATC should return himself to "CDM SLAVE" before the next controller takes over.

  \caption{A-CDM timeline with delaying TSAT example} \label{fig:acdm}
\end{figure}

Each departure follows a timeline of events from the moment a Flight Plan is submitted until the flight is airborne. These events are called "Milestones".

\medskip

The A-CDM calculation begins at Target Off Block Time (TOBT). TOBT is the time the aircraft is ready for startup, or push and start. This is typically the time at which the pilots reports "fully ready", or requests pushback or startup. In an optimal scenario this would match with the flight plan Estimated Off Block Time (EOBT, sometimes called ETD in other sources).

\medskip

A-CDM will calculate a Target Take Off Time (TTOT) based on the TOBT, current departure rate, known traffic and Flow Restrictions. Each TTOT is separated from other TTOTs by the amount of time required to achieve the maximum defined departure rate. During moments of high traffic that, without a regulation, would exceed the airport departure rate capacity, the system will delay the TTOT in order to meet the required departure rate. 

\medskip

Different Stands have different Estimated Taxi Out Time (EXOT). A stand closer to the runway will have a shorter EXOT than another further away. The system adds EXOT to TOBT, to obtain TTOT.

\bigskip

Target Start-up Time (TSAT) is the time at which a flight may push back and start up. 

If there is no delay, TSAT will be the same as TOBT. 

If there is a delay, TSAT will the difference from TTOT - EXOT. 

A TSAT has a validity window of -5 to +5 minutes, within which start-up approval may be issued. 

A TSAT within the validity window will be colored in \colorref{color1}, or if outside the validity window \colorref{color2}. Additionally, it will be colored in \colorref{color5} the minute it expires, as an attention getter.

If a flight misses its TSAT, a new one must be assigned by right clicking the TSAT value in order to set TOBT to present time and restart the CDM calculation for the concerned flight.

\medskip

During times of extraordinary demand, a Calculated Take-Off Time (CTOT) may be issued for a certain flight. The A-CDM operation remains the same, with the exception that it will try to match TTOT to CTOT. A CTOT has a validity window of -5 to +10 minutes of CTOT, during which Take Off clearance must be issued.

\medskip

During some events, a manually created list of callsign and CTOT pairs may be created. These are Event CTOT, or ECTOT. ECTOT on their own do not contribute to A-CDM calculations, unless manually added as a CTOT to the flight.

\medskip

Once A-CDM is made aware of the assignment of a CTOT to a flight, it will keep the same CTOT locked until a Ready Message (REA) is sent, even if the external source of the CTOT is updated with an improvement. 

\subsubsection{Examples}

The system first attempts to calculate a departure with no delay, by adding EXOT to TOBT it obtains TTOT. For example, TAP123 reports "fully ready" at 12:00 (TOBT 12:00), sitting on a stand with 15 minutes of taxi time (EXOT 15 minute), the system predicts TAP123 will be able to take off at 12:15 (TTOT 12:15). Because there is no conflict, TSAT is equal to TOBT (TSAT 12:00)

\bigskip

A second flight, RYR456, reports "fully ready" at the very next minute (TOBT 12:01), but is on a stand very close to the runway with a shorter taxi time (EXOT 5 minutes, for example), the system predicts RYR456 will be able to take off at 12:06 (TTOT 12:06). Because there is no conflict, TSAT is equal to TOBT (TSAT 12:01).

Notice how RYR456 was ready for push and start after TAP123, yet, because of the very short taxi time, it will take off much sooner that TAP123.

\bigskip

A third flight, IBE789, also reports "fully ready" at 12:01 (TOBT 12:01), sitting on a stand with 15 minutes of taxi time (EXOT 15 minute), the system predicts IBE789 will be able to take off at 12:16 (TTOT 12:16). 

However, this TTOT is too close to TAP123 (TTOT 12:15) and must be delayed for separation. 

The system calculates that according to the current departure rate, IBE789 must take off at 12:18 (TTOT 12:18). By subtracting the 15 minutes Estimated Taxi Out Time from the Target Take Off Time, the system obtains IBE789's Target Startup Time of 12:03 (TTOT - EXOT = TSAT, 12:18 - 15 = 12:03).

This is a very small delay, in fact so small that it falls within the TSAT window. IBE789 TSAT is 12:03, and because the TSAT window is +/- 5 minutes (11:58 - 12:08). IBE789 may be pushed back at anytime within this window.

\bigskip

A fourth flight, EJU321, is departing to the same destination as IBE789. This destination has limited capacity and can only accept arrivals in 15 minute intervals. The system will take care of this limitation, no intervention should be required.

EJU321 reports "fully ready" at 12:01 (TOBT 12:01), sitting on a stand with 15 minutes of taxi time (EXOT 15 minute), the system predicts EJU321 will be able to take off at 12:16 (TTOT 12:16). Because of the restriction at destination, the earliest time that EJU321 can take off, while remaining separated of IBE789, is 12:33 (IBE789's TTOT, 12:18, + 15 minutes required separation at destination).

The system assigns a Calculated Take Off Time of 12:33 to EJU321 (CTOT 12:33). By subtracting the taxi time from this (EXOT 15 minutes), the system obtains TSAT 12:18 (CTOT - EXOT = TSAT, 12:33 - 15 = 12:18).

EJU321 must wait on the stand until the TSAT window (12:13 - 12:23) before being able to pushb and start.

\section{Coordination}

TopSky provides various ways to coordinate information between controllers.

\bigskip

The example track labels do not represent any specific setup and are only meant to highlight the items specific to each function. In the examples, aircraft ABC123 is assumed by “transferring controller” and the next sector is referred to as “accepting controller”. For reference, the example labels would look like these before any coordination (coordination point TROIA, entry/exit level FL180):

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}
  Transferring controller:

  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
    {\color{Assumed} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDA}       & {\color{Assumed} }      \\
    {\color{Assumed} 100}    & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Assumed} TROIA} \\
    {\color{Assumed} 180}    & {\color{Assumed} }          & {\color{Assumed} }     
  \end{tabular}
  &

  Accepting controller:

  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
    {\color{Coordination} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDT}       & {\color{Coordination} }      \\
    {\color{Coordination} 100}    & {\color{Coordination} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Coordination} TROIA} \\
    {\color{Coordination} 180}    & {\color{Coordination} }          & {\color{Coordination} }     
  \end{tabular}
  \end{longtable}

\bigskip

Some of the coordination functions (ROF, RTI and TIP) require very specific conditions to exist to be able to send the necessary messages between the controllers. TopSky attempts to check for this and either disables the function (grey text in the menu button) or creates a warning message if the conditions are lost during a coordination, but in some cases the coordination messages can get lost. In this case try the coordination again or manually coordinate.

\subsection{PEL/COPN}

A coordination is displayed by coloring the proposed values \colorref{Proposition In} or \colorref{Proposition Out}, depending on whether the coordination was sent or received, in the track label and the flight lists. Additionally, a message is displayed in the \winref{win:miw} for received coordinations and in the \winref{win:mow} for coordinations sent by you.

\bigskip

To send a PEL (Planned Entry Level) coordination, left-click on the PEL value in the track label or a flight list. This opens a menu to select a value. To send a COPN (Entry Point) coordination, left-click on the COPN value in the track label or a flight list. This opens the \winref{menu:wpt}. Select “Probe”. This opens a menu to select the desired point. The response of the coordination can be a counter-proposal as well, in which case the color of the values remain \colorref{Proposition In}.

\bigskip

An example track label, showing both the PEL and COPN being coordinated:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{Coordination} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDT}       & {\color{Coordination} }      \\
  {\color{Coordination} 100}    & {\color{Coordination} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color[RGB]{225,130,180} TROIA} \\
  {\color[RGB]{225,130,180} 180}    & {\color{Coordination} }          & {\color{Coordination} }     
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

To answer an incoming coordination, left-click on a proposed value or the corresponding message in the \winref{win:miw}. This opens a menu where you can select the response (Accept, Refuse or Change). After the response, the track label and lists display depend on the answer:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{l l}
  Accept: & Accepted values, sector state color\\
  Refuse: & Original values, sector state color (EuroScope bug, should be \colorref{Warning})\\
  Change: & New proposed values in \colorref{Proposition Out}\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{XFL/COPX}

A coordination is displayed by coloring the proposed values \colorref{Proposition In} or \colorref{Proposition Out}, depending on whether the coordination was sent or received, in the track label and the flight lists. Additionally, a message is displayed in the \winref{win:miw} for received coordinations and in the \winref{win:mow} for coordinations sent by you.

\bigskip

To send an XFL (Exit Flight Level) coordination, left-click on the XFL value in the track label or a flight list. This opens a menu to select a value. To send a COPX (Exit Point) coordination, left-click on the COPX value in the track label or a flight list. This opens the \winref{menu:wpt}. Select “Probe”. This opens a menu to select the desired point. The response of the coordination can be a counter-proposal as well, in which case the color of the values remain \colorref{Proposition In}.

\bigskip

An example track label, showing both the XFL and COPX being coordinated:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{Assumed} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDA}       & {\color{Assumed} }      \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100}    & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color[RGB]{225,130,180} TROIA} \\
  {\color{Assumed} 180}    & {\color[RGB]{225,130,180} 200}          & {\color{Assumed} }     
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

To answer an incoming coordination, left-click on a proposed value or the corresponding message in the \winref{win:miw}. This opens a menu where you can select the response (Accept, Refuse or Change). After the response, the track label and lists display depend on the answer:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{l l}
  Accept: & Accepted values, sector state color\\
  Refuse: & Original values, sector state color (EuroScope bug, should be \colorref{Warning})\\
  Change: & New proposed values in \colorref{Proposition Out}\\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{HOP}
\label{coo:hop}
The purpose of the HOP (Hand-Over Proposal) message is for the transferring controller to propose the flight for hand-over to the accepting controller, and/or to propose non-standard transfer conditions which require the approval of the accepting controller.

\bigskip

To send a HOP without any transfer conditions, select the \winref{win:hop} option in the \winref{menu:cs}.

\bigskip

To send a HOP with a transfer condition (assigned heading, direct-to point or assigned speed):

\begin{enumerate}
  \item open the AHDG or ASP menu and select the "HOP" option (found in the “More” folder)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item See \winref{win:hop} for indications
  \end{itemize}
  \item select the desired value (to select a direct-to point, select the “Point” option in the AHDG menu and then left-click on the point on the radar screen
\end{enumerate}

The example labels below show a HOP with an assigned heading proposal:

\begin{longtable}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}
  Transferring controller:

\begin{itemize}
  \item SI item and any proposed values in \colorref{Proposition Out} color
  \item Message in Message Out Window
\end{itemize}

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{Assumed} ABC123} & {\color{Proposition In} IDA}       & {\color{Assumed} }\\
  {\color{Assumed} 100}    & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Assumed} TROIA}\\
  {\color{Assumed} 180}    & {\color{Assumed} }          & {\color{Assumed} }\\  
  {\color{Proposition In} H360}    & {\color{Assumed} }          & {\color{Assumed} }\\  
\end{tabular}
  &
  
  Accepting controller:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Callsign item and any proposed values in \colorref{Proposition In} color
  \item Message in Message In Window
\end{itemize}

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{Proposition In} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDT}       & {\color{Coordination} }\\
  {\color{Coordination} 100}    & {\color{Coordination} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Coordination} TROIA}\\
  {\color{Coordination} 180}    & {\color{Coordination} }          & {\color{Coordination} }\\
  {\color{Proposition In} H360}    & {\color{Coordination} }          & {\color{Coordination} }\\      
\end{tabular}
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

The transferring controller should monitor both the track label and the \winref{win:miw} as there are three ways for the accepting controller to answer a HOP. In order of preference, they are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item From the \winref{menu:cs}, select “ROF”. This sends a ROF message to the transferring controller.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item See \winref{menu:rof} for indications
  \end{itemize}
  \item Left-click on the AHDG, ASP or COPN item. This opens the \winref{menu:ctm}. In it, select “Accept”. This sends an Accept message to the transferring controller.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The labels on both controllers’ screens return to normal sector state coloring
    \item A message is put into the Message In Window for the transferring controller
    \item A message is put into the Message Out Window for the accepting controller
  \end{itemize}
  \item From the \winref{menu:cs}, select “Assume”. This assumes the aircraft (with the other two answers the aircraft remains assumed by the transferring controller)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The labels on both controllers’ screens return to normal sector state coloring
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\note{If a HOP is sent to a controller not using the TopSky plugin, it will only be displayed on your label. To the accepting controller it will look like a normal transfer. Any proposed values will be shown also on the accepting controller’s label but they will not be colored as proposals.

  If a HOP is sent to a manually selected controller and is answered by either “Accept” or “ROF”, the next controller is reset to the automatically calculated one. The correct controller needs to be manually selected again before transferring the aircraft.}

\subsection{ROF}
\label{coo:rof}

The ROF (Request on Frequency) message is sent by the accepting controller to the transferring controller when a flight establises radio contact but the label has not yet been transfered to the downstream sector. The upstream sector should then transfer the label. The message may also be used as a reply to HOP to signify the acceptance of the flight under the proposed conditions.

\warn{ROF should not be used to request an early handover of a flight. ROF is a coordination tool that is context dependent, using it outside the prescribed scenarios or ir other unintended ways will cause unnecessary confusion.}

To send a ROF message, select the “ROF” option in the \winref{menu:cs} of the aircraft in question. The example labels below show the indications when the message is sent:


\begin{longtable}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}
  Transferring controller:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item ROF text in \colorref{Proposition In} color
    \item Message in Message In Window
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
    {\color{Proposition In} ROF} & {\color{Coordination} }       & {\color{Assumed} }      \\
    {\color{Assumed} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDA}       & {\color{Assumed} }      \\
    {\color{Assumed} 100}    & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Assumed} TROIA} \\
    {\color{Assumed} 180}    & {\color{Assumed} }          & {\color{Assumed} }     
  \end{tabular}
  &
  
  Accepting controller:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item ROF text in \colorref{Proposition Out} color
    \item Message in Message Out Window
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
    {\color{Proposition In} ROF}  & {\color{Coordination} }                 & {\color{Coordination} }      \\
    {\color{Coordination} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDT}              & {\color{Coordination} }      \\
    {\color{Coordination} 100}    & {\color{Coordination} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Coordination} TROIA} \\
    {\color{Coordination} 180}    & {\color{Coordination} }                 & {\color{Coordination} }     
  \end{tabular}

\end{longtable}

The indications are removed when a “Transfer” or “HOP” is performed.

\note{If a ROF is sent to a controller not using the TopSky plugin or the message fails to go through, an error message will be put into the Personal Queue Window. The message counter in the Global Menu will be highlighted in \colorref{Global Menu Highlight} color if the window is not open.}

\subsection{RTI/TIP}
\label{coo:rti}\label{coo:tip}
These messages are used to request/propose the transfer of a flight on an assigned heading, speed or rate of climb/descent. RTI (Request Tactical Instructions) is a request initiated by the accepting controller and TIP (Tactical Instructions Proposal) a proposal initiated by the transferring controller.

\bigskip

In the examples below the RTI message is used. For the TIP message, the indications and actions are the same, only the roles are reversed – the transferring controller sends and the accepting controller answers the message, so the message will appear in the other Message Window.

To send the RTI message:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item open the AHDG, ASP or ARC menu and select the “RTI” option (found in the “More” folder) 
  \item select the desired value in the list (“Point” option in the AHDG menu is not available)
\end{enumerate}

When the message is sent, the following indications are shown:

\begin{longtable}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}
  Transferring controller:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Proposed value in \colorref{Negotiation In} color
    \item Message in Message In Window
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
    {\color{Assumed} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDA}       & {\color{Assumed} }      \\
    {\color{Assumed} 100}    & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Assumed} TROIA} \\
    {\color{Assumed} 180}    & {\color{Assumed} }          & {\color{Assumed} } \\
    {\color{Negotiation In} H360}    & {\color{Assumed} }          & {\color{Assumed} }  \\         
  \end{tabular}

  &
 
  Accepting controller:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Proposed value in \colorref{Negotiation Out} color
    \item Message in Message Out Window
  \end{itemize}

  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
    {\color{Coordination} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDT}       & {\color{Coordination} }      \\
    {\color{Coordination} 100}    & {\color{Coordination} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Coordination} TROIA} \\
    {\color{Coordination} 180}    & {\color{Coordination} }          & {\color{Coordination} } \\
    {\color{Negotiation Out} H360}    & {\color{Coordination} }          & {\color{Coordination} }  \\        
  \end{tabular}
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

To answer the message, left-click on the proposed value. This opens the \winref{menu:ahdg}, \winref{menu:asp} or \winref{menu:arc} in a mode where you can either accept or reject the proposal. When clicking on “Ack”, the menu closes and the following indications are displayed:

\begin{longtable}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}
  Transferring controller:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Relevant label field value in \colorref{Reminder} color (until the accepted value is set)
    \item Message in Message Out Window
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
    {\color{Assumed} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDA}       & {\color{Assumed} }      \\
    {\color{Assumed} 100}    & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Assumed} TROIA} \\
    {\color{Assumed} 180}    & {\color{Assumed} }          & {\color{Assumed} }\\     
    {\color{Reminder} H360}    & {\color{Assumed} }          & {\color{Assumed} }     
  \end{tabular}

  &

  Accepting controller:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Relevant label field value in \colorref{Reminder} color (until the accepted value is set)
    \item Message in Message In Window
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
    {\color{Coordination} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDT}       & {\color{Coordination} }      \\
    {\color{Coordination} 100}    & {\color{Coordination} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Coordination} TROIA} \\
    {\color{Coordination} 180}    & {\color{Coordination} }          & {\color{Coordination} }  \\   
    {\color{Reminder} H360}    & {\color{Coordination} }          & {\color{Coordination} }  \\   
  \end{tabular} 
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

When the accepted value has been set, the label field returns to the sector state color. When replying to an RTI message, the menu also includes an “Accept” option which, in addition to accepting the coordination, also immediately sets the value. While the coordinated value is being shown in the label field, it is possible to display the currently set value temporarily by hovering the mouse cursor over the label and keeping the <ALT> key pressed.

\bigskip

On the other hand, if “Reject” is chosen, the menu closes the indications are as follows:

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{0.45\textwidth} p{0.45\textwidth}}
  Transferring controller:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Rejected value in \colorref{Warning} color
    \item Message in Message Out Window
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
    {\color{Assumed} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDA}       & {\color{Assumed} }      \\
    {\color{Assumed} 100}    & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Assumed} TROIA} \\
    {\color{Assumed} 180}    & {\color{Assumed} }          & {\color{Assumed} }\\  
    {\color{Warning} H360} & {\color{Assumed} }       & {\color{Assumed} }      \\       
  \end{tabular}

  &

  Accepting controller:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Rejected value in \colorref{Warning} color
    \item Message in Message In Window
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{tabular}{
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
    >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
    {\color{Coordination} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDT}       & {\color{Coordination} }      \\
    {\color{Coordination} 100}    & {\color{Coordination} $\blacktriangle$} & {\color{Coordination} TROIA} \\
    {\color{Coordination} 180}    & {\color{Coordination} }          & {\color{Coordination} }  \\     
    {\color{Warning} H360} & {\color{Coordination} }       & {\color{Coordination} }      \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

A rejected coordination value will be removed from the label after 60 seconds or by right-clicking the value.

\note{If an RTI or TIP is sent to a controller not using the TopSky plugin or the message fails to go through, an error message will be put into the Personal Queue Window. The message counter in the Global Menu will be highlighted if the window is not open.}

\subsection{Coordinating more than one value}

It is possible to coordinate more than one value, either before or after the previous proposal has been answered. However, if more than one proposal is active, clicking on “Ack” or “Reject” to one will send the same answer to all of them. Therefore, it is recommended to wait for an answer until sending another proposal unless the intention of the proposal is to get “all or nothing”.

\bigskip

For example, if you send an RTI with AHDG 360 (as in the above example) and then send another with ASP 300 (either immediately or after the first coordination is answered), the label field on line 0 will only show the ASP proposal. When opening the Tactical Transfer menu, all the proposals and accepted values are shown. If more than one proposal is active, clicking on “Accept” or “Reject” will send the same answer to all of them. Therefore, it is recommended to wait for an answer until sending another proposal unless the intention of the proposal is to get “all or nothing”.

\subsection{Data stored in the flight strip annotation boxes}

TopSky stores some data in the flight strip annotation boxes (the group of nine boxes in three columns on the right side of the strip). This enables you to send this data to the next controller, or any other controller by manually pushing the strip. In addition, TopSky automatically pushes the strip when a handoff proposal (HOP) is sent.

\bigskip

TopSky needs to be able to use three of the nine boxes for its functions. They are the boxes marked with X’s in the picture below. Do not manually edit those boxes or use them to store any other data. The other boxes, marked by minus signs, are currently not used by TopSky in any way.

\capdimage{img/strip.png}{Unusable flight strip boxes}

\section{Datalink}

TopSky uses \textit{\href{http://www.hoppie.nl/acars}{Hoppie’s ACARS network}}. A separate password (logon code) is needed, and it can be \textit{\href{https://www.hoppie.nl/acars/system/register.html}{requested from that site}}. 

\bigskip

TopSky supports Departure Clearance (DCL) and Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC).

\bigskip

To start using the data link functions, first connect to the VATSIM network. Then connect to the Hoppie network:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Open the \winref{win:dls}
  \item Enter/check the login callsign
  \item Enter/check your personal logon code
  \item Select whether to provide CPDLC or DCL services or both
  \item Left-click on the “Connect” button
\end{itemize}

The “Connect” button will change to “Online” with a green background. Wait at least 10 seconds to see if the connection is successful. Error messages regarding the connection will be shown in the \winref{win:pqw}. 

\warn{Attempting to connect with a CPDLC login callsign that is already in use will not fail instantly, and may take up to 10 seconds for the error message to be added to the \winref{win:pqw}}

The Hoppie logon code expires after 120 days of inactivity. If that happens, the connection will fail and a new logon code has to be requested.

\bigskip

If the connection is lost, an error message dialog will be displayed in the center of the radar screen. Note that if multiple EuroScope instances are used, the proxy instances will not be able to access the CPDLC message windows or change the network connection status.

\bigskip

TopSky may sometimes fail to parse the message contents correctly. The longer the message, the more likely it is that the parsing will fail. When in doubt, open the message in the \winref{win:dlcmw}.

\bigskip

The example track labels do not represent any specific setup and are only meant to highlight the items specific to each function. In the examples, aircraft ABC123 is assumed by you, the next controller is “IDA”, the aircraft is climbing through FL100, and its cleared level is FL180. This is the label before any messages arrive:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{Assumed} ABC123} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 180} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

When the aircraft requests to start a CPDLC connection, it sends a “REQUEST LOGON” message. The message is displayed in the \winref{win:dlcmw} and the Callsign field gets blinking square brackets around it (not on proxy ES instances). TopSky automatically denies requests for aircraft not entering your sector. To approve the request, use the “Start CPDLC” button in the \winref{menu:cs}. To deny the request, left-click on the message in the \winref{win:dlcmw} and select “UNABLE”. It is also possible to accept if necessary, but the \winref{menu:cs} is the primary way to do it.

\bigskip

When the request has been accepted, the Callsign field will get steady square brackets around it. This indicates that the aircraft is CPDLC connected and available to exchange CPDLC messages with.

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 180} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

To terminate the CPDLC connection of an aircraft, use the “End CPDLC” button in the \winref{menu:cs}.

\note{While it is possible to answer any message in the \winref{win:dlcmw} using the “Manual Reply” option, the track label menus should always be used to answer correctly recognized messages, as using the manual reply method will not update the track label values.}

\subsection{Departure Clearance (DCL)}

ARINC-623 DCL is a service used in Europe and many other parts of the World. It is a direct ATC-to-pilot data link communication over the ACARS network.

\bigskip

The departure clearance functionality is built into the Departure List. A received clearance request is displayed in the list, and a clearance can be sent by opening the \winref{win:dlpdcw} via left clicking the RWY or SID fields of the Departure List.

\bigskip

A DCL follows a chronological sequence of events that must be completed in order to communicate a clearance.

\subsubsection{Departure Clearance Request (RCD)}

The aircraft sends a clearance request message (RCD). The message is also shown in the \winref{win:dlcmw}:

\begin{quote}
  REQUEST PREDEP CLEARANCE ABC123 A320 TO ESSA AT LPPT STAND 221 ATIS PAPA
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Flight System Message (FSM)}

If the request is correctly formatted, TopSky may automatically reply with a Departure Clearance Message (CLD) message if all the conditions in \winref{win:dlsdcl} are met. If not all conditions are met, TopSky will automatically send a flight system message (FSM) as a reply. Its content depends on whether all the requirements for a DCL are met (flight plan found, departure airport offers data link clearances, etc.). If so, the following reply message is sent to the aircraft:

\begin{quote}
  DEPART MESSAGE STATUS FSM 1312 221113 LPPT ABC123 RCD RECEIVED REQUEST BEING PROCESSED STANDBY 
\end{quote}

The Clearance Flag tag item will show a “R” text in \colorref{Warning} color. If the request contained remarks text after the ATIS indicator, “R” alternates with “•”.

\bigskip

If a clearance is not sent before the timeout occurs, the data link clearance request is automatically rejected and a message is sent to the aircraft to revert to voice procedures.

\begin{quote}
  RCD REJECTED REVERT TO VOICE PROCEDURES
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Departure Clearance Message (CLD)}

The clearance is sent using the \winref{win:dldclw}, opened by left clicking the RWY or SID fields of the Departure List. 

The clearance is sent using the “Send MSG” button. “R/T” rejects the data link clearance request and sends a message to the aircraft to revert to voice procedures. 

\begin{quote}
  LPPT PDC 001 CLD 1314 221113 LPPT PDC 001 ABC123 CLRD TO ESSA OFF 02 VIA IXIDA5N SQUAWK 3251 QNH 1012
\end{quote}

Once the clearance is sent, the Clearance Flag item will change to “S”.

\bigskip

If there is still no answer from the aircraft when the timeout occurs, the data link clearance is automatically rejected and a message is sent to the aircraft informing it that the received clearance has been cancelled.

\begin{quote}
  ACK NOT RECEIVED CLEARANCE CANCELLED REVERT TO VOICE PROCEDURES
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Departure Clearance Readback (CDA)}

A clearance can be answered to with either “WILCO” to accept it or “UNABLE” to reject it.

\subsubsection{Flight System Message (FSM)}

Once a reply is received, the Clearance Flag item changes to a filled box (for WILCO) or to "F" (for UNABLE). A message is automatically sent to the aircraft.

\begin{quote}
  ATC REQUEST STATUS FSM 1317 221113 LPPT ABC123 CDA RECEIVED CLEARANCE CONFIRMED 
\end{quote}

If an UNABLE reply is received, clearance must then be negotiated and delivered by voice. A message is automatically sent to the aircraft.

\begin{quote}
  CONTACT ATC BY VOICE REFUSE NOT SUPPORTED BY DATALINK
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Abnormal operations}

Most failure cases result from the message not being correctly formatted, and TopSky failing to recognize it correctly. Regardless of whether TopSky recognizes the message as belonging to a departure clearance sequence, it will be put into the \winref{win:dlcmw}. In case the system fails, revert to voice communications.

\subsection{Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC)}
\label{cpdlc}

CPDLC is a means of communication between controller and pilot, using data link for ATC communications, and with the extra advantage of displaying data on the track labels and flight lists as well.

\bigskip

As the messages take significant amount of time to get through (receiving a reply to a clearance can take anything from seconds to a couple of minutes), using CPDLC should be limited to situations that are not time-critical. For this reason, it is mostly used in upper airspace area control sectors.

\bigskip

The messages are grouped to dialogues, with an opening message and subsequent replies. Some messages do not need a reply, while for others a specific reply is expected. The available replies are set automatically, so only the correct type of reply can be sent.

\subsubsection{Allowed message types}
\label{cpdlc:amt}

TopSky supports for the following message types:

\begin{longtable}{|p{4.5cm}|p{4.5cm}|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Uplink}             & \textbf{Downlink} \endhead \hline
  Level clearance             & Level request\\ \hline
  Heading clearance           & Heading request\\ \hline
  Direct-to clearance         & Direct-to request\\ \hline
  Speed clearance             & Speed request\\ \hline
  Squawk code assignment      & MAYDAY/PAN/SQ7500\\ \hline
  Squawk ident instruction    & Free text\\ \hline
  Voice contact instruction   & \\ \hline
  Free text                   & \\ \hline
  \caption{Supported CPDLC message types}
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Non-supported message types}
\label{cpdlc:nmt}

TopSky does not support the following downlink message types. They will be automatically closed and a reply sent informing that the system does not support the message type:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Any requests containing “When can we expect”, “At pilots discretion” or “Own separation”
  \item Level requests for a cruise climb, block level, or any level request tied to a position or time
  \item Lateral requests for an offset, weather deviation or ground track
  \item Speed requests to maintain a speed range
  \item Voice contact requests
  \item Requests for a procedure name and/or type
  \item Position reports
\end{itemize}

Note that a non-allowed message type can be classified as “free text” by TopSky if the message parser doesn’t recognize it as a non-allowed type. In this case the automatic reply will not be sent and it is recommended to use the "MESSAGE NOT SUPPORTED BY THIS ATS UNIT" message from the \winref{cpdlc:freetext} set, and archiving the dialogue.

\subsubsection{Uplink clearance sequence}
\label{cpdlc:ucs}

In this example a level clearance is used. The clearance is sent using the \winref{menu:cfl}. To send the clearance using CPDLC, check that the “CPDLC” option is selected. Depending on the aircraft’s altitude, by default it may be selected or deselected. Send the clearance by selecting a level value.

In this case FL200 was selected, and the CPDLC message “CLIMB TO FL200” was sent to the aircraft. The uplinked value is shown in brackets and in \colorref{CPDLC UM Clearance} 

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{CPDLC UM Clearance} [200]} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

The aircraft has responded with “STANDBY”. The uplinked value changes to \colorref{CPDLC Standby} color, and a warning is inserted on line 0 of the label. The warning can be acknowledged by left-clicking on it:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{CPDLC Standby} CFL SBY} & & \\
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{CPDLC Standby} [200]} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

The aircraft then eventually answers with “WILCO”. The CFL value is updated accordingly and the label field colors return to normal:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 200} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

If the aircraft answers with “UNABLE”, a warning is inserted in line 0 of the label:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{CPDLC Standby} CFL UNA} & & \\
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{CPDLC Standby} [200+]} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

The “+” after the level indicates that there is a reason in the answer message, for example “DUE TO PERFORMANCE”. The reason given is only accessible from the \winref{win:dlcmw}.

\bigskip

Left-clicking on the warning acknowledges it and the original CFL value is again shown in the label:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 180} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Downlink request sequence}
\label{cpdlc:drs}

This example shows a level request.

\bigskip

The aircraft has sent a level request for FL200. The value is shown in the RFL field in brackets and in \colorref{CPDLC DM Request} color:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 180} & {\color{CPDLC DM Request} [200]} & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

The responses to a level request are sent using the \winref{menu:rfl} or \winref{menu:cfl}. The \winref{menu:rfl} offers the possibilities to respond with “STANDBY” or “UNABLE”, the \winref{menu:cfl} with a level clearance (to the requested level or some other level). In this case the sequence then changes to an uplink clearance – see above for details.

\bigskip

If a free text CPDLC message is received from the aircraft, “CPDLC MSG” will be inserted above the label in \colorref{CPDLC DM Request} color:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{CPDLC DM Request} CPDLC MSG} & & \\
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\   
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

Left-clicking on the warning will clear it and close all related dialogues. Right-clicking will open the \winref{win:dlcmw}.

\subsubsection{Free Text Messages}
\label{cpdlc:freetext}

A set of premade free text messages is included for use in the \winref{menu:dlftm} and is acessible via the \winref{menu:cs} or \winref{win:dlcmw}:

\begin{table}[H]

        \end{tabular}
    }
    \caption{CPDLC Free Text Messages}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Abnormal operations}
\label{cpdlc:abn}

As with DCL messages, the most likely failure scenario is TopSky misinterpreting the contents of a received message, which can be verified on the \winref{win:dlcmw}. Some other failure scenarios are presented below.

\bigskip

If TopSky has temporarily lost contact with the CPDLC server, “CPDLC FAIL” will be inserted in line 0 of the labels of all CPDLC connected aircraft in \colorref{CPDLC Failed} color.

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{CPDLC Standby} CPDLC FAIL} & & \\
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 180} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

In case the server connection is not re-established within a certain time, the connection will be automatically closed and a warning message box will be presented. A new connection can be attempted at any time from the \winref{win:dls}.

\bigskip

During temporary connection issues and also when the connection is automatically closed, the “AGCS” system label in the \winref{win:geninfo} will be displayed with \colorref{Warning} color until a connection is re-established.

\bigskip

If the CPDLC connection is terminated by the pilot, a “CPDLC P ABT” warning is inserted in line 0 of the label in \colorref{CPDLC Failed} 

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{CPDLC Standby} CPDLC P ABT} & & \\
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 180} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

Left-clicking on the warning acknowledges it.

\bigskip

If an uplink clearance is not answered in time, a “<message type> P LATE” warning will be inserted in line 0 of the label in \colorref{CPDLC Pilot Late}

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{CPDLC Pilot Late} CFL P LATE} & & \\
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 180} & & \\         
  {\color{CPDLC Pilot Late} [200]} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

Left-clicking on it opens the \winref{menu:dlplam} with options to either abort the clearance or manually mark it as aswered with “WILCO”. Manually marking should be done only after a satisfactory readback is obtained by voice.

\bigskip

If sending an uplink clearance failed, a “<message type> ERR” warning will be inserted in line 0 of the label in \colorref{CPDLC Failed} 

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{CPDLC Failed} CFL ERR} & & \\
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 180} & & \\         
  {\color{CPDLC Failed} [200]} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

Left-clicking acknowledges the warning and aborts the clearance, displaying the previous value in the label.

\bigskip

If an uplink clearance is sent successfully but you are not the Current Data Unit in the aircraft’s CPDLC system, a “<message type> NOT CDA” warning will be inserted in line 0 of the label in \colorref{CPDLC Failed}:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l 
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l
  >{\columncolor{Flight Highlight}}l }
  {\color{CPDLC Failed} CFL NOT CDA} & & \\
  {\color{Assumed} [ABC123]} & {\color{Coordination} IDA} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 100} & {\color{Assumed} $\blacktriangle$} & \\
  {\color{Assumed} 180} & & \\         
  {\color{CPDLC Failed} [200]} & & \\         
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

Left-clicking acknowledges the warning and aborts the clearance, displaying the previous value in the label.

\section{Flight Plan Conflict Probe}

\warn{The use of Safety Nets does not relieve the controller from manually identifying and correcting conflicts. Safety Nets are generally configured with conservative values in respect to minimum separations. Even so, the controller must be aware that it is impossible to configure Safety Nets to catch all possible conflict situations.}

\subsection{MTCD (Medium Term Conflict Detection)}
\label{tool:MTCD}
\subsubsection*{General}

The MTCD system is a tool that enables the controller to predict possible future conflicts between aircraft. The look-ahead time (prediction time) is set to 20 minutes and the separation distance that triggers the alert (prediction distance) to 5 NM within the 3 NM separation area, 7 NM within the 5 NM separation area, and 10 NM within the 8 NM separation area.

\bigskip

In the lateral plane the system works by checking the aircraft’s predicted route up to the defined prediction time and calculating if the separation with other aircraft will be less than the defined prediction distance.

\bigskip

In the vertical plane, TopSky predicts a climb or descent and accounts for buffer zones:

\capdimage{img/mtcdv.png}{MTCD Vertical Path}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Conflicts (area with red shading)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item detected within 4000ft around the predicted vertical path of the aircraft between AFL and CFL/PEL
        \item current clearances may lead to a loss of separation
    \end{itemize}
    \item Conflict risks (area with yellow shading)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item detected within 4000ft around the predicted vertical path of the aircraft between AFL and RFL/XFL
        \item current clearances will not lead to a loss of separation, but modifying the clearance to the predicted path (CFL=RFL/XFL) will create a conflict
    \end{itemize}
    \item Potential predicted conflicts (area with light red shading)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item detected between tracks with equal CFL/PEL values, maintaining the same AFL, when the predicted path contains further climb/descent
        \item current clearances result in a loss of separation if further climb/descent is not given
        \item at least one of the tracks must be \stateref{Assumed}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Potential risks of conflict (area with light yellow shading)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item detected within 10000ft but within the minimum and maximum levels of the predicted vertical path
    \end{itemize}
    \item Potential conflicts (area with light blue shading)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item detected within 10000ft, outside of the minimum and maximum levels of the predicted vertical path
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

For the predictions to be accurate, it’s very important to keep the CFL and the aircraft’s route updated at all times. For aircraft that have an assigned heading or a RAM warning, the system assumes that it will continue on its present track and ground speed for a specified time and stops the prediction there. The system is always disabled for flight plan tracks with an assigned heading.

\bigskip

MTCD is not available for aircraft on the ground until their state is set to “DEPA”, or aircraft below 8500ft.

\subsubsection*{Conflict and Risk display on the track label}

If there is a conflict or potential predicted conflict for the aircraft within the set warning parameters, a “•” in \colorref{Urgency} color is shown 10 minutes to loss of separation with a 5nm, 7nm or 10nm separation minimum, depending on the sector.

\bigskip

The MTCD conflicts are also displayed in the \winref{win:card}.

\subsection{SAP (Segregated Area Probe)}
\label{tool:SAP}
\subsubsection*{General}

Much like the MTCD system predicts future conflicts between aircraft, the SAP system predicts future intrusions into active areas. The system uses the same look-ahead time as the MTCD system. The future position predictions are done at one-minute intervals which means a very short intrusion into an active area may not be noticed by the system. The classification into risks and conflicts is the same as in MTCD: a conflict means that the current clearance will lead to the aircraft entering an active area, whereas a risk means that the current clearance will not lead to that but clearing the aircraft to its XFL or some other level beyond the current CFL may do so.

\bigskip

As with MTCD, keeping the CFL and the aircraft’s route updated is important for the system’s operation. For aircraft that have an assigned heading or a RAM warning, the prediction logic is the same as in the MTCD case. SAP is disabled for non-altitude reporting traffic that do not have a manually set AFL.

\subsubsection*{Conflict and Risk display on the track label}

A conflict is shown by displaying the Military coordination indicator (“M”). Note that once the indicator is clicked and changes to inactive state, the system will not give further warnings for that aircraft as long as the indicator is in the inactive state. Click on the inactive indicator to re-arm the system once the aircraft has passed all the areas for which crossing clearance was given.

\bigskip

SAP conflicts are also shown in the \winref{win:sap}.

\section{Monitoring Aids}

\warn{The use of Safety Nets does not relieve the controller from manually identifying and correcting conflicts. Safety Nets are generally configured with conservative values in respect to minimum separations. Even so, the controller must be aware that it is impossible to configure Safety Nets to catch all possible conflict situations.}


\subsection{CLAM (Cleared Level Adherence Monitoring)}
\label{tool:CLAM}
\subsubsection*{General}

The CLAM system warns if an aircraft is not maintaining its cleared level and its vertical rate is not towards the cleared level. The alert is inhibited when the cleared level is lower than 100ft, and for aircraft in level flight, for 30 seconds after a new cleared level is set.

\subsubsection*{Alert Display}

An alert is shown by displaying a “diverging” type aircraft position symbol and the text “L” in the \tagref{tag:CLAM} track label field.

\subsection{RAM (Route Adherence Monitoring)}
\label{tool:RAM}
\subsubsection*{General}

The RAM system warns if an aircraft is deviating from its route by more than 1nm. The alert is inhibited 30nm from the departure and destination, and a larger cross-track error (5nm) is allowed near waypoints where the route makes a turn over 10° course change.

\bigskip

For aircraft on a direct-to clearance, the alert is given if the difference between the aircraft’s track and the direct track to the cleared point exceeds 5°. After a direct-to clearance is given, the alert is inhibited for 60 seconds or until the aircraft’s track is towards the point, whichever happens first.

\subsubsection*{Alert Display}

An alert is shown by displaying a “diverging” type aircraft position symbol.

\section{Safety Nets}

\warn{The use of Safety Nets does not relieve the controller from manually identifying and correcting conflicts. Safety Nets are generally configured with conservative values in respect to minimum separations. Even so, the controller must be aware that it is impossible to configure Safety Nets to catch all possible conflict situations.}


\subsection{AIW (Airspace Infringement Warning)}
\label{tool:AIW}
\subsubsection*{General}

The AIW system warns if an uncontrolled aircraft is already inside or going to enter controlled airspace within a defined time. The system will only scan correlated radar tracks.

\subsubsection*{Alert display}

An alert is shown by displaying the text “AIW” in the \tagref{tag:AIW}. The AFL item is also colored \colorref{AIW intrusion} and a one-minute-along prediction line is displayed in \colorref{AIW intrusion} color regardless of the prediction line settings.

\subsection{APW (Area Proximity Warning)}
\label{tool:APW}
\subsubsection*{General}

The APW system warns if an aircraft is inside or about to enter a Temporary Segregated Airspace without clearance. The position of the aircraft is only predicted in 30 second intervals for performance reasons so very short future intrusions may not be noticed by the system. The areas are defined in an external text file and activated in the \winref{win:amw}.

\subsubsection*{Alert display}

An alert is shown by displaying the text “APW” in the\tagref{tag:APW}.

\subsection{MSAW (Minimum Safe Altitude Warning)}
\label{tool:MSAW}
\subsubsection*{General}

\note{MSAW is currently not implemented}

The MSAW system alerts when an aircraft is flying at an altitude below the minimum safe altitude. The minimum safe altitude data is read from an external file. There is an adjustable buffer value in the system that allows some altitude variation below the safe altitude to inhibit nuisance alerts for aircraft flying at the minimum safe altitude and not staying exactly at that altitude.

\subsubsection*{Alert display}

An alert is shown by displaying the text “MSAW” in the \tagref{tag:MSAW}.

\subsection{STCA (Short Term Conflict Alert)}
\label{tool:STCA}
\subsubsection*{General}

The STCA system is designed to alert the controller of a possible or actual loss of separation between aircraft. The alert is given between 60 seconds and 120 seconds before a loss of separation is predicted to happen, but it is dependent on the relative positions and movement of the aircraft. The alert will not be shown if both aircraft have STCA alerting inhibited (see the \winref{win:snsw}), are inside exclusion areas for parallel approaches, or when either aircraft is inside an active STCA inhibit area. LPPR, LPPT, LPCS, LPFR, LPMA and LPPS CTR are defined as STCA inhibit areas

\bigskip

In the vertical plane the STCA function will assume that an aircraft will level off at its cleared level. This will reduce the number of nuisance alerts caused by climbing and descending aircraft in busy airspace, but will delay the alert in case an aircraft continues through its cleared level. The alert will then be given only after the failure to level off is seen by the system.

\subsubsection*{Alert display}

An alert is shown by coloring the \tagref{tag:CALLSIGN} item background or the text itself in \colorref{Urgency} color. A one minute long prediction line is displayed in \colorref{Urgency} color regardless of the prediction line settings. The radar position symbol and history dots are displayed in \colorref{Urgency} color.

\bigskip

An aural alert can also be generated if the corresponding setting is enabled in the \winref{menu:global}.

\bigskip

Whenever at least one STCA alert is active, an STCA Alert List is automatically opened.

\capdimage{img/stcal.png}{STCA Alert List}

The list displays for each alert the callsign/FLTID/TSSR of each track, the minimum predicted horizontal separation between them, and a checkbox.

\bigskip

The alerts are sorted by minimum predicted horizontal separation. The list cannot be manually closed, it will close automatically when there are no more active alerts.

\section{Sector States}

Depending on a set of conditions and relationships, each Flight Plan is defined as being in a certain state relative to each airspace volume. This is the so called Sector State. As a given flight progresses along its route it will go through a series of diferent Sector States relative to a given airspace volume. 

\bigskip

Track presentation coloring depends on the flight sector state:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| p{2.5cm} p{2.5cm} p{8cm} |}
  \hline
  \textbf{State}                                                  & \textbf{Color}               & \textbf{Condition}\\ \hline
  Initial (Unconcerned) \nextrow \label{state:Unconcerned}        & \colortabex{Unconcerned}     & Track will not enter the active sector\\ \hline
  Free (Unconcerned)\nextrow \label{state:Free}                   & \colortabex{Unconcerned}     & Track is not assumed or on-contact with anyone\\ \hline
  Notified \nextrow \label{state:Notified}                        & \colortabex{Concerned}       & Track will enter the active sector (> 15 min)\\ \hline
  Coordinated \nextrow \label{state:Coordinated}                  & \colortabex{Coordination}    & Track will enter the active sector (< 15 min)\\ \hline
  Assumed \nextrow \label{state:Assumed}                          & \colortabex{Assumed}         & Track is assumed\\ \hline
  On Contact \nextrow \label{state:On Contact}                    & \colortabex{Assumed}         & Track is on-contact with you. Flight is considered as Uncontrolled\\ \hline
  Transfer Initiated \nextrow \label{state:Transfer Initiated}    & \colortabex{Assumed}         & Track is being transferred to the next controller. \tagref{tag:CALLSIGN} and \tagref{tag:SI} are colored in \colorref{Redundant} color\\ \hline
  Redundant \nextrow \label{state:Redundant}                      & \colortabex{Redundant}       & Track has been transferred to the next controller but is still inside the active sector\\ \hline
  Informed  \nextrow \label{state:Informed}                       & \colortabex{Informed 1}      & Track will not enter the active sector but is relevant to it\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Sector States are used to control label construction, placement in lists, filtering, coloring, Safety Net parameters and availability. For example, a Flight Plan in the \stateref{On Contact} state will not trigger an APW warning until already being inside a TSA and will be shown in the \winref{list:uncon}. The same flight but in the \stateref{Assumed} state will trigger the APW warning when less than 3nm of a TSA and will not be shown in the \winref{list:uncon}.

\bigskip

\stateref{Coordinated} tracks that have not departed yet are displayed as \stateref{Notified}.

\chapter{User Interface}

\section{Main Window}
\capdimage{img/mainwindow.png}{Main Window on initialization}

TopSky should load with some preplaced windows similar to the above configuration

\note{Screen resolutions other than 1920x1080 will yield different results. Larger resolutions will bring preplaced windows towards the left and middle, while smaller resolutions may potentially place windows outside the screen. It is recommended for users experiencing difficulties related to their screen size to experiment and create custom settings in the TopSkySettingsLocal file containing revised window placements adjusted for their own screen. Refer to \texttt{\detokenize{TopSky_Developer_Guide_Settings.xlsx}} for available settings}

On initialization TopSky will load the \winref{menu:global} on top, \winref{list:sector} and \winref{list:dep} on the top left, \winref{win:miw} and \winref{win:mow} on the top center right, \winref{win:notamlw} on center, \winref{win:card} and \winref{win:sap} on bottom right, plus legacy weather and controller lists on top right as well.

\section{Global Menu}
\label{menu:global}
\capdimage{img/globalmenu.png}{Global Menu}

The Global Menu is located on the top edge of the radar screen. It displays the current UTC time (left-clicking opens the \winref{win:clock}) and contains a number of submenus which are explained below.

\subsection{Setup Menu}
\label{menu:set}
\capdimage{img/Setup.png}{Setup Menu}

Setup Menu allows for various adjustments. Each position will load its defined settings based on the active Primary Frequency.

Most used options are CPDLC Setting for CPDLC operations and Default Settings to reset options.

Personal settings can be defined in \texttt{\detokenize{TopSky_Developer_Guide_Settings.xlsx}} (see the Developer Guide).

When enabled, the list options bar displays “Info Conc Redu Filter Filter” on the right edge of the \winref{menu:global}. The first three toggle the respective settings for the \winref{list:sector} and are colored with the appropriate color when enabled, and the last two are displayed in \colorref{Redundant} color when the corresponding \winref{list:uncon} are somehow filtered. Clicking on them opens the \winref{menu:fplists} to change the filtering options.

\bigskip

Left-clicking <filter> cycles through “ALL” (no filtering), “ON-CONTACT” (only tracks \stateref{On Contact} with anyone), “ON-CONTACT-PPOS” (only tracks \stateref{On Contact} with you) and “FREE” (only tracks in the \stateref{Free} state).

\bigskip

Left-clicking <units> opens a text entry box to enter a comma-separated list of aerodrome ICAO codes to filter the list. When entered, the list will display a flight only if one of the entered codes is its departure or destination, or the code is found in \tagref{tag:OP TEXT2}.

\bigskip

Left-clicking <lfunc>, <adep>, <ades> and <via> open text entry boxes to enter comma-separated lists for controlled ID’s, ICAO codes and point names respectively to filter the affected lists.

\bigskip

Left-clicking <state> toggles between “ALL” (no filtering), “SIMUL+TERM” (not started flight plans filtered), “NOTST+SIMUL” (terminated flight plans filtered) and “SIMUL” (not started and terminated flight plans filtered).

Open the \winref{win:pqw} to view the messages or see \winref{menu:status} for more detailed information on the problem(s). The number is limited to 99, and is shown on \colorref{Global Menu Highlight} background when not zero and the window is not open.

\bigskip

Left-clicking the number opens the \winref{win:pqw}.

\subsubsection{Plugin Status submenu}
\label{menu:status}
Shows the version of TopSky as well as some information on the loaded data files. Each data file reports its state with one of the following indicators:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{l l}
- OK        & File contains usable information and no faults\\
- NO DATA   & File not found or contains no usable information\\
- BAD DATA  & File contains invalid data (in \colorref{Warning} color)\\
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

Depending on the file, there are one to three of the following buttons available:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{l l}
- Reload                    & Reloads the data file\\
- View                    & Displays the data in the file on the radar display\\
- Save (Areas)            & Saves a snapshot of the current area activation data\\
- Save set (Maps \& MapsL) & Saves a list of currently active radar screen specific maps\\
- Load set (Maps \& MapsL) & Loads a saved list of active screen specific maps\\
\end{tabular}\\ 

\bigskip

Left-clicking the Save button will save the currently set manual activation periods as well as the information if an area with automatic schedules is set to manual mode. The information is saved to the \texttt{TopSkyAreasManualAct.txt} file in the same folder as \texttt{TopSky.dll}. If the file already exists, TopSky will ask for confirmation as the save operation will overwrite any existing data. 

\bigskip

Depending on the maps data file setup, the display state of some or all of the maps may be specific to each radar screen. The Save set and Load set functions can be used to transfer the display state of these maps from one radar screen to another.

\bigskip

Right-clicking the Reload button for Settings \& SettingsL has a special purpose. It opens a text entry box to type in a callsign whose settings should be loaded instead of the real login callsign. When entered, the callsign will be displayed next to the “Reload” button, and whenever a VATSIM callsign change is detected, an information popup is displayed to remind that TopSky settings are still forced to the manually entered callsign. This feature can be used for example to use settings for different positions on different EuroScope instances when providing top-down services, or to use settings for a specific position when logged in with an observer/staff/supervisor callsign. Clearing the entered callsign reverts to using the settings based on the actual login callsign.

\subsubsection{Supervisory submenu}
\label{menu:super}

\begin{tabular}{l l}
- Operations Rate...     & Opens the \winref{win:orw}\\
- Predicted Traffic... & Opens the \winref{win:ptw}\\
\end{tabular}
\medskip 

\subsection{RRxxx/Off}

Opens the \winref{menu:rr}. If the rings are selected on,

\bigskip

“xxx” displays the distance between consecutive rings, otherwise “Off”.

\subsection{Mxxx-yyy}
\label{menu:mfil}

Displays the status of the altitude filters for the Main Radar Window. If enabled and Quick Look is not toggled on, the color of the text is \colorref{Global Menu Highlight}. “xxx” displays the Lower filter value and “yyy” the Upper filter value, in hundreds of feet.

\bigskip

Left-clicking the item opens the \winref{win:afw}.

\subsection{S000-999}

Displays the status of the altitude filters for the Secondary Radar Window (not implemented, shows static values)

\section{Aircraft Position Symbol}

The position symbol is drawn at the latest known position of the aircraft. The color of the symbol is the flight sector color for an unselected track and \colorref{Track Highlight} for a selected one.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[max height=0.80\textheight,max width=0.80\textwidth]{img/tracks.png}
  \caption{Track Symbology}
\end{figure}

If a surveillance track does not receive position updates in over 30 seconds it becomes a Coasted track, position is no longer reliable.

If a Coasted track does not receive position updates for long enough, or it has originated outside of surveillance coverage, it becomes a FPASD track. FPASD tracks are not based on surveillance data but estimated based on Flight Plan data.

\bigskip

Except for the FPASD and Coasted tracks, a divergence alert will be drawn in case of a RAM or CLAM alert. This is a circle drawn around the symbol. Tracks with SPI active will not display this symbol.

\subsection{History dots}

The history dots show the previous positions of the track. The number of displayed dots can be changed via the \winref{win:tcw}. The color of the dots is the flight sector color for an unselected track and \colorref{Track Highlight} for a selected one. History dots are not displayed for flight plan tracks.

\subsection{Prediction Line}

The prediction line draws the predicted ground track of the aircraft, based on its current track and ground speed. It is a two-color line, starting with \colorref{Track Default} at the position symbol and then alternating with \colorref{Track Highlight}, with every segment representing one minute of flying time. 

The default lenght of the prediction line is 2 minutes, and can be changed for all tracks via the \winref{win:tcw}, or for a single track via the \winref{menu:prl}. Prediction lines are not displayed for flight plan tracks.

\capdimage{img/rps_predline+history_selected.png}{Selected track with 5 history dots and a 3-minute prediction line}

\subsection{Track filtering}\label{win:tf}

For all the filters, it is only possible to filter out \stateref{Unconcerned} tracks. Aircraft with transponder codes 7500, 7600 and 7700 and tracks with an active STCA, MSAW, APW or DUPE alert are also excluded from filtering. If a filter is active, the filter title in the Radar Menu will be shown in \colorref{Selected} color.

\bigskip

All filters, with the exception of the CJI filter, remove all components of the tracks, nothing remains visible. The CJI filter leaves the track position symbol and history dots visible.

The filters can be overridden using the Quick Look (all filters), Quick Look Up/Down (altitude filter only) and Individual Quick Look (CJI filter only) functions.

\bigskip

  \item \winref{win:ssr}
\end{itemize}

\section{Track Labels}
\label{tlabel}

There are four types of track labels that can be displayed: Standard, Reduced, Extended and Uncoupled.

In addition, each label except the extended one has an unselected and a selected state, the selected state being shown when the mouse cursor is over the label.

\bigskip

The unselected Standard and Reduced labels can be minimized to display only some of their contents. When a label is minimized, the Callsign item is prefixed with a “<” to serve as a reminder.

\subsection{Standard Track Label}
\label{tlabel:std}

The Standard label is shown for aircraft that are in or will enter the active sector.

\subsection{Label Compaction}
\label{tlabel:comp}

Label fields may be automatically supressed in certain conditions. This is called Label Compaction.

Label Compaction only occurs in unselected labels. When a field is supressed, the remaining fields to the right will move left to the supressed field position. If all fields in a line are supressed, the next line is moved up to the supressed line position. Values being coordinated are exempted from Label Compaction.

\bigskip

The following Label Compaction rules are in place:

\begin{itemize}
  \item If a field is empty it is supressed
  \item If AFL is the same as CFL, CFL is supressed
  \item If AFL is the same as CFL and XFL, CFL and XFL are supressed
  \item If AFL is the same as CFL, but different from XFL, only CFL is supressed
  \item If AFL is different from CFL, and CFL is the same as XFL, XFL is supressed
  \item If AFL is different from CFL, and CFL is different from XFL, no field is supressed
  \item If FCOPX is the same as NPT, NPT is supressed
\end{itemize}

\section{Track Label Menus}

These menus are opened from track label fields or flight lists. Except for the confirmation windows, they are closed automatically when a menu option is chosen or the mouse cursor leaves the menu area. The mouse wheel can be used to scroll the selection lists in the menus.

\bigskip

Many of the menus have a default item or value, displayed with inverse video. The menu usually opens so that the default value is located under the mouse cursor for easy selection. Some menus contain items that open folders within the menu. They show a filled triangle before the item name (upright if the folder is closed, inverted if the folder is open). The “More” folder is opened automatically when the mouse cursor is placed over it or if the default item is in the “More” folder, other folders must be left-clicked to open.

\subsection{Callsign Menu}\label{menu:cs}

Items in the callsign menu that are currently not available (for example “Assume” for a track that is not free or being transferred in) are hidden to make the menu as small as possible, so the example images below do not show all the possible items. In the other menus the unavailable items are displayed with \colorref{Arm} color.

\subsection*{Controlled Track}

\end{longtable}

\footnotetext[1]{Clicking “On Contact” for a track with “Y” or “Z” flight rules will also automatically change the flight rules in the VATSIM flight plan to VFR in order to make it uncontrolled. The displayed flight rules are not affected.}

\bigskip

Besides the manual alerts, none of the selectable toggle options in this menu will be transmitted to other controllers, but the “Mark”, “Freq” and highlight selections will be seen in your other EuroScope instances. A holding clearance is broadcast to all controllers in range when given, and additionally transmitted to the next controller when transferring the track. To correlate a flight plan, first click on the "Couple" item, and then click on the radar position symbol of the desired radar track.

\bigskip

\subsection*{Uncontrolled Track}

\end{tabular}

\footnotetext[1]{Clicking “Assume” for a track with “Y” or “Z” flight rules will also automatically change the flight rules in the VATSIM flight plan to IFR in order to make it controlled. The displayed flight rules are not affected.}


\subsection*{Uncorrelated Track}

\capdimage{img/cmuncor.png}{Uncorrelated Track Callsign Menu}

\begin{tabular}{l l l}

\end{tabular}
\medskip

\subsection{Transfer menu}
\label{menu:xfr}

\capdimage{img/xfr.png}{Transfer Menu}

For CPDLC connected aircraft, the menu contains options related to the transfer. Left clicking on the frequency button initiates the transfer (and sends the CPDLC message if selected).

\bigskip

“Monitor” / “Contact” select which of the two CPDLC message types will be sent.

\bigskip

“R/T” / “CPDLC” select whether the transfer instruction is given via radio or as a CPDLC message.

\subsection{Transfer Confirmation Window}
\label{win:xfrconfirm}

\capdimage{img/xfrconfirm.png}{Transfer Confirmation Window}

If an aircraft has a defined XFL value and hasn’t been cleared to it (CFL is not equal to XFL), attempting to transfer the aircraft will open a Transfer Confirmation Window in the middle of the radar screen. While the window is open it will block all other attempts to click on items elsewhere on the radar screen. Either click on “Transfer” to transfer the aircraft regardless of the situation, or “Cancel” to cancel the transfer.

\subsection{Request On Frequency message}
\label{menu:rof}

See \winref{coo:rof}. For the message to succeed, you must be seen as the next controller for the tracking controller. When sent, the text “ROF” is displayed in the track label on the tracking controller’s screen.

\warn{The “ROF” message is a feature specific to this plugin. It is an experimental feature and is not guaranteed to work all the time. When you send the message, check that it’s sent properly.
\begin{enumerate}
        \item A successfully sent message will be displayed in the \winref{win:mow}
        \item If there is an error or the message fails to go through, a message will be put into the \winref{win:pqw}
\end{enumerate}}

\subsection{Hold/Susp Menu}
\label{menu:hold}

\capdimage{img/hold.png}{Hold Menu}

The Hold/Susp menu allows you to enter a holding clearance, adding the aircraft to the \winref{list:hold}. It displays for selection the points in the aircraft’s route that are ahead of its current position.

\bigskip

Left-clicking the empty box below the waypoint list opens a text entry box to enter any holding point name.

\bigskip

Left-clicking “Here” enters the present position coordinates as the holding point.

\bigskip

The “Suspend” folder contains a list of all currently active TSA areas. Left-clicking on one sets the aircraft to a TSA Hold. A TSA Hold clearance will exclude the aircraft from all APW and SAP processing.

\subsection{Manual Transfer Menu}
\label{menu:mxfr}

\capdimage{img/mxfr.png}{Manual Transfer Menu}

The Manual Transfer menu allows transferring the aircraft to any controller. In the SCHEDULED list are the controllers that are in the current sector sequence sorted in the order the aircraft is planned to enter the controllers’ sectors, with the next controller being the default item.

\bigskip

When opened, the “More” list displays all the other controllers for selection. Click on a controller ID to start the transfer. For CPDLC connected aircraft, clicking on a controller ID opens the \winref{menu:xfr}

\subsection{VCI Menu}
\label{menu:vci}

\capdimage{img/vci.png}{VCI Menu}

Available only for CPDLC-connected aircraft and when more than one frequency has been set up by the controller, the VCI menu allows sending a CPDLC “contact” or “monitor” message without initiating a transfer.

\bigskip

The first button displays the primary frequency, left-clicking it will send the message with that frequency.

\bigskip

Left-clicking the “Select Freq” button will open a text entry box to enter any other frequency. If a valid frequency (set up as XMT TXT in EuroScope’s Voice communication setup dialog) is entered, the message will be sent with that frequency.

\bigskip

“Monitor” and “Contact” are used to select the type of message to be sent.

\subsection{CPDLC Free Text Menu}
\label{menu:dlftm}

See \winref{cpdlc:freetext}. Left-clicking on a message sends it.

\bigskip

The menu closes when a message is sent or the cursor leaves the menu area.

\subsection{Prediction Line Menu}
\label{menu:prl}

\capdimage{img/prl.png}{Prediction Line Menu}

The Prediction Line menu allows displaying a PRL with a specific length for each aircraft even if the PRL selection is off in the Radar Menu.

\bigskip

The default value is the set PRL value if available, otherwise the PRL length value from the Track Control Window. Changing the PRL length value in the \winref{win:tcw} or changing the PRL setting in the \winref{menu:radarm} will delete all manually set PRL lengths.

\subsection{Sequence Number Menu}
\label{menu:seq}

\capdimage{img/seq.png}{Sequence Number Menu}

This menu is used to set an arrival sequence number. Values from 1 to 50 are available.

\bigskip

\warn{The sequence number will not be transmitted to other controllers except the next controller (during transfer) unless the flight strip is manually sent.}

\subsection{Waypoint Menu}
\label{menu:wpt}

\capdimage{img/wpt.png}{Waypoint Menu}

This menu gives access to functions related to the route of the aircraft. It is used to assign direct-to clearances, holding clearances, and to coordinate the sector entry/exit point.

\bigskip

Left-clicking on a point in the list sets a direct-to clearance to that point. Any point name can be manually entered in the box at the bottom of the menu.

\warn{Note that no coordination is performed. If coordination is necessary, right-click any point name to open the EuroScope “COPN/COPX point” popup list or use the “Probe” button instead.}

\bigskip

When the aircraft is CPDLC-connected and the coordination is an exit coordination, the menu offers a choice between “R/T” and “CPDLC”. The chosen option decides how a clearance is communicated to the aircraft.

\bigskip

“Probe” opens the EuroScope “COPN point” or “COPX point” popup list and draws the Flight Leg for the flight. Moving the mouse cursor over the points in the popup can be used to probe the effects of possible route changes. Allow up to 5 seconds after each point change for FPCP to update. The popup is also used to start point coordinations.

\bigskip

For “HOP” see \winref{menu:ahdg}.

\bigskip

Left-clicking “Hold” opens the \winref{menu:hold}. If a holding clearance already exists, the button will read “XHold” and clicking it will remove the clearance.

\capdimage{img/wptyn.png}{Waypoint Menu in Coordination}

When an entry or exit coordination has been received, the menu options are:

\begin{longtable}{p{5cm} p{7.5cm}}
Accept                    & Accepts the coordination\\
Reject                    & Rejects the coordination\\
Probe                     & Opens EuroScope popup to counter-propose another point\\
\end{longtable}

With “CPDLC” selected, when “Accept” is clicked, in addition to the coordination being accepted, a “PROCEED DIRECT TO <point>” CPDLC message is sent to the aircraft.

\capdimage{img/wptroute.png}{CPDLC Waypoint Menu}

When a direct-to downlink request has been received, the menu can be used to answer it.

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{5cm} p{7.5cm}}
Point name  & Sends a “PROCEED DIRECT TO <point>” CPDLC message\\
SBY         & Sends a “STANDBY” CPDLC message\\
UNABLE      & Sends an “UNABLE” CPDLC message\\
\end{longtable}   

\bigskip

The “R/T” / “CPDLC” selection is fixed to “CPDLC”.

\warn{Clicking the point name will set the direct-to clearance without coordination}

When there is no request in process and the aircraft has a direct-to point set, the menu can be used to send the clearance via CPDLC. In this case the menu opens like this except without the “SBY” and “UNABLE” buttons. Clicking the point name will send the “PROCEED DIRECT TO <point>” CPDLC message.

\subsection{AFL Menu}
\label{menu:afl}

\capdimage{img/afl.png}{AFL Menu}

This menu can be used to set the AFL value for aircraft that don’t have an altitude reporting transponder.

\bigskip

The default value is the previously set manual AFL value if set, otherwise the CFL value.

\bigskip

There are two ways to set the AFL using this menu:

\begin{itemize}
        \item Clicking a level value in the list
        \item Clicking the text entry box below the level list and entering the value there
\end{itemize}

The accepted manual level entry formats for the AFL, CFL and RFL menus are as follows (“n” is a number):

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{5cm} p{7.5cm}}
“Annn” or “nnn”         & Altitude in hundreds of feet\\
“Ennn”                  & Height in hundreds of feet above aerodrome elevation\\
\end{longtable}    

\bigskip

Regardless of whether the entered value is an altitude or height, it will be converted to altitude in feet and the result is then rounded to the nearest 100 feet.

\subsection{CFL Menu}
\label{menu:cfl}
\capdimage{img/cfl.png}{CFL Menu}

The CFL menu is available only when the aircraft is assumed. The default value is by default the XFL, but it can be changed to the current CFL or the RFL in the \winref{menu:localset}. Altitudes up to the transition altitude are prefixed with “A”, QFE heights are prefixed with “E”. Selectable values are from 500ft to FL650 with 500ft intervals up to the transition altitude, then 1000ft intervals up to FL410 and 2000ft intervals above it. 

\bigskip

The aircraft’s RFL is displayed above the level list with format “R<RFL>”. Left-clicking it sets the CFL equal to RFL.

\bigskip

“VA”, “CA”, “CAT2” and “CAT3” set the corresponding approach clearances.

\bigskip

“Probe” toggles a CFL probe function and displays the Flight Leg. Moving the mouse cursor over the levels in the list will show the MTCD/SAP effects of setting that value as the CFL (allow a couple of seconds for the FPCP to update the calculations).

\bigskip

There are four ways to set the CFL using this menu:

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
        \item Clicking the RFL value;
        \item Clicking a level value in the list;
        \item Clicking one of the approach clearance items;
        \item Clicking the text entry box at the bottom of the menu and entering the value there.
\end{itemize}

\capdimage{img/cfldl.png}{CPDLC CFL Menu}

For CPDLC connected aircraft, the menu contains “R/T” and “CPDLC” options to select whether a level clearance is to be sent via radio or as a CPDLC message.

\bigskip

When a level request downlink has been received, the “R/T” option is deselected and cannot be selected. The request must be replied to using CPDLC. A clearance to the requested or some other level is given using this menu. The “STANDBY” and “UNABLE” responses are sent from the RFL menu.

\bigskip

When a level clearance uplink is waiting for reply, the “CPDLC” option is deselected and cannot be selected. If a new level clearance must be sent before there is an answer to the uplink, it must be given using R/T (doing so also closes the open uplink message).

\subsection{RFL Menu}
\label{menu:rfl}

\capdimage{img/rfl.png}{RFL Menu}

The RFL menu allows setting the requested flight level. The operation is similar to the AFL and CFL menus. The function for the "-->" button is not implemented.

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/rfldl.png}{RFL Menu during ongoing downlinked request}

For CPDLC connected aircraft, if a level request has been received from the aircraft, there are also “SBY” and “UNABLE” buttons to send those messages as a reply. For clearing the aircraft to the requested or some other level, the CFL menu must be used.

\subsection{AHDG Menu}
\label{menu:ahdg}

\capdimage{img/ahdg.png}{AHDG Menu}

This menu includes items to set or clear an assigned heading or a direct route and to send a HOP. The initially highlighted heading value will be the closest one to the assigned heading if the aircraft has one, otherwise the closest one to the aircraft ground track, or the departure runway heading if the menu is opened from the \winref{list:dep}. Clicking on a heading value will set it as the assigned heading. The assigned heading can also be set by typing it into the entry box or by using the AHDG vector.

\bigskip

"LLZ” enters a localizer clearance.

\bigskip

The “More” folder contains the following additional options:

\begin{itemize}
  \item “Point” lets you pick a direct-to point from the radar screen. Left-click on any point to set it as the direct-to point (VORs, NDBs and waypoints, in that priority order). Pressing the [Esc] key or clicking on any clickable data field will abort the operation;
  \item “HOP”, “RTI” and “TIP” are coordination functions (see \winref{win:hop}, \winref{win:rti}). To use them, first click on the function’s button and then select the desired value from the list (for HOP also “Point” is available);
  \item “Clear” removes an assigned heading or a direct route. For CPDLC connected aircraft, it sends the “RESUME OWN NAVIGATION” CPDLC message if the “CPDLC” option is selected.
\end{itemize}

\capdimage{img/ahdgdl.png}{CPDLC AHDG Menu}

\bigskip

For CPDLC connected aircraft, the menu contains additional buttons:

\bigskip

“R/T” and “CPDLC” select whether a heading/direct-to clearance is to be sent using R/T or as a CPDLC message.

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
        \item When a heading request downlink has been received, the “R/T” option is deselected
    and cannot be selected. The request must be replied to using CPDLC.
        \item When a heading/direct-to clearance uplink has been sent, the “CPDLC” option is deselected and cannot be selected. If a new heading/direct-to clearance must be sent before there is an answer to the uplink, it must be given via radio (doing so also closes the open uplink message).
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

“SBY” and “UNABLE” send the corresponding answers to a downlink heading request
message.

\warn{Clicking a point on the radar screen will set the direct-to clearance without coordination }

\subsection{AHDG Vector}\label{menu:ahdgv}

The AHDG vector is a way of setting an assigned heading for an aircraft. To use the vector, left-click on the radar position symbol of the aircraft. This will start drawing the vector. When you’re satisfied with the heading value, left-click again to set it. Right-clicking will abort drawing the vector.

\bigskip

When the cursor is over a known point (VOR, NDB or waypoint), the name of that point is displayed instead of the heading value, and left-clicking will set a direct-to clearance to that point. To temporarily disable the known points functionality, keep the <ALT> key pressed while using the vector.

\subsection{Handover Proposal (HOP)}
\label{win:hop}

See \winref{coo:hop}. For the receiving controller a HOP is identified by coloring the \tagref{tag:CALLSIGN} field with \colorref{Proposition In} color in the label. For the sending controller the \tagref{tag:CALLSIGN} field remains \colorref{Assumed} color and the \tagref{tag:SI} field is shown in \colorref{Proposition In} color. Additionally, if there are proposed parameters they are also colored \colorref{Proposition In} in both controllers’ labels.

\bigskip

There are three ways to answer a HOP and all of them involve accepting all proposed parameters. If one or more parameters are not acceptable, coordination must be done to find acceptable parameters or to revert to standard ones. The available ways, in order of preference, to accept the proposed parameters are:

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{5cm} p{7.5cm}}
  \winref{menu:cs} -> “ROF”               & Sends a Request On Frequency message\\
  \winref{menu:ctm} -> “Accept”      & Sends an Accept message\\
  \winref{menu:cs} -> “Assume”            & Assumes the track\\
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

If the parameters are unacceptable to the receiving controller, the sending controller has the possibility to modify or clear them using the appropriate menus, or to cancel the whole HOP by assuming the track.

\warn{A HOP will only be shown correctly for controllers using this plugin. To other controllers it will be shown as a normal transfer without any special coloring of any data fields. This combined with the three possible ways to answer the HOP require the sending controller to pay special attention to the track to see what the result is.}

\warn{If a HOP is sent to a manually selected controller, the next controller selection will be reset to the automatically calculated controller when an “ROF” or “Accept” answer is received. The correct controller must then be manually selected again for the transfer.}

\subsection{Request Tactical Instructions (RTI) / Tactical Instructions Proposal (TIP)}\label{win:rti}\label{win:tip}

Certain tactical data (AHDG, ASP and ARC) can be coordinated using the \winref{coo:rti} functions. Their only difference is that RTI is used for requesting the parameters when the aircraft is inbound to your sector and your sector is the next in the sector sequence, and TIP for proposing the parameters to the next sector when the aircraft is assumed. Contrary to the \winref{win:hop} function, these coordinations can be refused using the system, and they do not offer the aircraft for transfer.

\capdimage{img/rti.png}{TIP Menu during ongoing AHDG coordination}

To answer the RTI/TIP, open the \winref{menu:ahdg}. For TIP, the menu contains just two options, “Ack” (accept proposal) and “Reject” (reject proposal). For RTI, an additional “Accept” option is available. Like “Ack”, it accepts the proposal, but it also sets the value. For CPDLC connected flights, the “R/T” and “CPDLC” options are used to determine whether the clearance is to be sent as a CPDLC message or using RTF.

\warn{It is possible to have received more than one type (AHDG/ASP/ARC) of RTI/TIP. When answering one of them, the same answer will be sent to all the others as well. When selecting the “Accept” option, only that type’s value will be set (for example when AHDG and ASP RTI have been received and selecting “Accept” from the AHDG menu, both RTIs will be accepted but only the AHDG value will be set accordingly, and ASP value will have to be set separately)}

\warn{The “RTI” and “TIP” messages are features specific to this plugin. They are experimental features not guaranteed to work all the time. When you send these messages, check that they are sent properly.

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
        \item A successfully sent message will be displayed in the \winref{win:mow} and the requested parameter being shown above the track label
        \item If there is an error or the message fails to go through, a message will be put into the \winref{win:pqw}.
\end{itemize}}

\subsection{ARC Menu}
\label{menu:arc}

\capdimage{img/arc.png}{ARC Menu}

The ARC menu allows assigning a rate of climb or descent to the flight plan. Values are displayed in 100’s of ft/min.

\bigskip

Left-clicking on a value assigns it. Clicking the “-” or “+” next to a value sets the clearance as a maximum or minimum rate respectively. Clicking the value itself will set the clearance as an exact rate.

\bigskip

For “HOP”, “RTI” and “TIP” see the \winref{menu:ahdg}.

\bigskip

An assigned rate can be cleared by selecting the “Clear” item.

\warn{The exact and maximum rate clearances are a feature specific to this plugin (the additional information is stored in the flight strip). To controllers not using TopSky, all assigned rate clearances will only show the rate value.

Assigned rate clearances given by controllers not using TopSky will be displayed as minimum rate clearances. }

\subsection{ASP Menu}
\label{menu:asp}

\begin{center}
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.14\textwidth}\end{minipage}\hfill 
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.14\textwidth}\capdimage{img/asp.png}{ASP Menu}\end{minipage}\hfill 
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.14\textwidth}\capdimage{img/aspmach.png}{ASP Menu Mach option}\end{minipage}\hfill  
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.14\textwidth}\end{minipage}\hfill 
\end{center} 

\bigskip

The ASP menu allows setting an assigned speed or Mach number. The default value will depend on the assigned one if set (assigned+20kts for departures, assigned or slightly less for arrivals), otherwise it will be either a pre-defined value or the current DMACH if available. The menu will initially open in IAS mode if the aircraft’s CFL is below FL285, and in Mach mode if above it. The selectable values range from 100 to 400 knots and from M0.50 to M1.00.

\bigskip

Left-click the units button to toggle between IAS and Mach.

\bigskip

The “HS” option will set a clearance for “high speed”, displayed as “HS” in the ASP label field.

\bigskip

The “+” and “-” options can be used to specify the clearanceas a minimum/maximum speed.

\bigskip

For “HOP”, “RTI” and “TIP” see the \winref{menu:ahdg}.

\bigskip

The “Resume” item clears an assigned value. For CPDLC connected aircraft, it sends the “RESUME NORMAL SPEED” CPDLC message if the “CPDLC” option is selected.

\capdimage{img/aspmachdl.png}{CPDLC ASP Menu}

For CPDLC connected aircraft, the menu contains additional buttons:

\bigskip

R/T” and “CPDLC” select whether a speed clearance is to be sent via radio or as a CPDLC message.

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item When a speed request downlink has been received, the “R/T” option is deselected and cannot be selected. The request must be replied to using CPDLC.
    \item When a speed clearance uplink has been sent, the “CPDLC” option is selected and cannot be deselected. If a new speed clearance must be sent before there is an answer to the uplink, it must be given via radio (doing so also closes the open uplink message).
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

SBY” and “UNABLE” send the corresponding answers to a downlink speed request.

\warn{The minimum, maximum and high speed clearances are a feature specific to this plugin (the additional information is stored in the flight strip). To controllers not using TopSky, all assigned speed clearances will only show the speed value (999 for the high speed clearance). Assigned speed clearances given by controllers not using TopSky will be displayed as exact speed clearances.}

\subsection{SSR Code Menu}\label{menu:assr}

\capdimage{img/assr.png}{ASSR Menu}

The SSR Code menu allows assigning an SSR code to the flight plan. To enter a new code, type it by left-clicking the numbers. “C” clears the entered value and “Ok” assigns the code if it’s a valid one. To get an automatically assigned code, left-click the “Get SSR” button.

%\bigskip
%
%Depending on the configuration, the assigned code may be a mode S conspicuity code. To force a discrete code, make a new assignment – either manual or automatic. If an automatic assignment is requested for a flight with the conspicuity code currently assigned, the new assignment will be a discrete code.
%

\bigskip

When the SSR Code menu is opened to start the \winref{func:findt} function, the top row of the menu will read “Find” and the “Get SSR” button will not be present. Enter a code and click “Ok” to start the function.

\subsection{Combined Transfer Menu}
\label{menu:ctm}
\capdimage{img/ctm.png}{Combined Transfer Menu}

The Combined Transfer menu displays the proposed transfer parameters for a \winref{coo:hop}. It is opened by clicking on the \tagref{tag:AHDG}, \tagref{tag:ASP} or \tagref{tag:COPN/COPX} items in the track label or flight list, or the list row displaying the HOP message in the \winref{win:miw}.

\bigskip

From top to bottom, the displayed values are the direct-to point, speed/Mach value, and the assigned heading value. If one or more of them are not proposed, the value will be replaced by the string “none” (the image above shows the menu for a HOP without any proposed parameters). Clicking on “Accept” will send a message to the upstream controller that the proposed parameters, if any, are all acceptable.

\subsection{Aerodrome Menu}
\label{menu:ad}
\capdimage{img/ad.png}{Aerodrome Menu}

The Aerodrome menu is used to select the aerodrome(s) for aerodrome related windows and functions. The list contains all aerodromes with runways defined in the active sector file. To select an aerodrome, left-click on it or type its identifier into the text entry box below the list.

\bigskip

Selection of more than one aerodrome is possible when the menu was opened from the \winref{win:wxmw}. In this case the “All” button is available and clicking on it will select all the aerodromes in the list.

\bigskip

Clicking on “Ok” will confirm the selection(s) and close the menu.

\subsection{CPDLC Emergency Acknowledgement Menu}
\label{menu:dleam}
\capdimage{img/dlmayday.png}{CPDLC Emergency Acknowledgement Menu}

When a CPDLC emergency message has been received, this menu is used to respond to it (if applicable), and then acknowledge the situation. When a reply is required, the menu button will read “ROGER”. Left-clicking on it will send the “ROGER” CPDLC message and close the menu. When opening the menu again (or when a reply was not required), the button reads “Ack”. Left-clicking on it will acknowledge the emergency. 

\bigskip

The menu is closed when the “ROGER”/“Ack” button is clicked or the cursor leaves the menu area.

\subsection{CPDLC Pilot Late Acknowledgement Menu}
\label{menu:dlplam}
\capdimage{img/dlplate.png}{CPDLC Pilot Late Acknowledgement Menu}

When there is no answer to a CPDLC uplink clearance, this menu can be used to resolve the situation. “Abort” discards the uplink and “Manual WILCO” simulates reception of a WILCO message.

\subsection{Time Menu}
\label{menu:tm}
\capdimage{img/etd.png}{Time Menu}

The Time menu is used to set/change the time value for ATD, CTOT, EOBT, ETD, NBT and NLT fields.
Default values are:

\begin{longtable}{p{5cm} p{7.5cm}}
ATD     & Current time\\
CTOT    & current field value if available, current time otherwise\\
EOBT    & Current time\\
ETD     & Current field value\\
NBT     & Current field value if available, current time otherwise\\
NLT     & current field value if available, current time otherwise\\
\end{longtable}

“C” clears the value, “Ok” sets the time.

\subsection{Departure Sequence Menu}
\label{menu:dqm}
\capdimage{img/dsq.png}{Departure Sequence Menu}

The DSQ menu is used to select a specific departure sequence number to a flight. The list includes the possible numbers, and the current number is highlighted. Left-clicking on a number sets it, “Clear” removes the flight from the departure sequence.

\note{The departure sequence number is only stored locally, it is not sent to other controllers or even to other EuroScope instances.}

\subsection{Holding List}\label{list:hold}

\capdimage{img/hlist.png}{Holding List}

The Holding List contains aircraft that have been given a holding clearance (by default the aircraft need to be at least in the coordinated sector state). The list is automatically displayed whenever there is at least one aircraft in the list. Left-clicking the button at the top right corner collapses the list to display only the title bar.

\bigskip

It is possible to set up point-specific lists using the plugin settings file, in which case the generic list includes aircraft that are in a TSA hold, present position hold or holding at a point for which there is no specific list defined. For point-specific lists, the list title text begins with the point name.

\bigskip

“View” opens the View menu

\begin{longtable}{p{5cm} p{7.5cm}}
  Header  & Toggle visibility of the list header line\\
  Default & Sets field visibility to default (all optional fields off)\\
  <field> & Toggles field visibility\\
\end{longtable}

Left-clicking adjusts only the current list, right-clicking sets the same value to all holding lists.

\bigskip

The list sorting option is displayed next to the "View" label. Clicking on it opens a menu to select between the following sorting options:

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{5cm} p{7.5cm}}
  ETO/HPT     & ETO at the holding point -> Holding point name -> Callsign\\
  HPT/CFL/AFL & Holding point name -> CFL -> AFL -> Callsign\\
  FX/STA      & Feeder fix name -> Scheduled time at feeder fix -> Callsign\\
\end{longtable}

For point-specific holding lists, the sorting options are “ETO”, “CFL/AFL” and “FX/STA”.

\bigskip

The ETO column initially displays the estimated time over the holding fix. Once the aircraft enters the holding, the displayed time is fixed to the holding start time. For present position holds and holding points whose positions are unknown, the time when the holding clearance was given is displayed.

\begin{longtable}{|p{0.25\textwidth}|p{0.25\textwidth}|p{0.25\textwidth}|p{0.10\textwidth}|} \hline

  \end{longtable}

If a track label has been hidden, it will be automatically unhidden if the aircraft is cleared to leave the holding or an incoming coordination message for the flight is received.

\subsection{Unsupported Lists}
\label{list:unsup}

EuroScope's default Sector Inbound, Sector Exit, Arrival, Startup, Taxi Out, Take-Off, ADC Sector, Taxi In, Flight Plan, and Conflict lists are not supported and should not be used.

\section{Windows}
TopSky includes a number of windows that are discussed in this chapter. All windows have the following common features:

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dragging the title bar using the left mouse button will move the window
    \item Dragging the box in the bottom right corner with the left mouse button will resize the window
    \item Left-clicking the top right corner will close the window
    \item Left-clicking the title bar will position the window on the top of other windows
    \item Right-clicking the title bar will position the window below other windows
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

While resizing the windows always starts from the bottom right corner, it is also possible to resize the window to the direction of the top and/or left edges. To do this, continue dragging the bottom right corner until the cursor goes past the top or left edge. As all windows have a defined minimum size, nothing will seem to happen once you reach the minimum size until the cursor crosses the opposite edge, but then the resize operation will continue normally.

\bigskip

Some windows contain scrollbars to select values or change the items that are displayed:

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item Dragging a scroll bar slider using the left mouse button will move the slider
    \item Left-clicking on the scrollbar background area outside the slider will move the slider by a predefined amount (in list windows, the view will be scrolled by the number of visible items)
    \item Right-clicking on the scrollbar background area outside the slider will position the slider to the clicked position
    \item Left-clicking on the arrow at the end of the slider will scroll the list by one line
    \item The mouse wheel can be used to scroll some scrollbars (most of the ones that have defined steps for scrolling, i.e. those with the arrows at the ends)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Other window-specific mouse function areas are explained below. All functions use the left mouse button unless otherwise specified. For each window, the way(s) to open it are listed below the chapter title.

\subsection{Radar Menu}
\label{menu:radarm}

<ALT> + Right-click anywhere on the radar screen background

\capdimage{img/radarmenu.png}{Radar Menu}

\begin{longtable}{p{5cm} p{7.5cm}}
    Radar Menu          & Locks/unlocks the menu display\\

    LAT/LONG…           & Opens the \winref{win:latlon}\\
    Find Track          & Opens the \winref{menu:assr} for the \winref{func:findt} function\\
    Scale Marker        & Toggles the Scale Marker on/off\\
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

When unlocked, the Radar Menu closes when a selection is made or the cursor leaves the menu area.

\subsection{QDM Vector}
\label{tool:qdm}

To draw a new QDM vector:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Left-click on the “QDM” \winref{menu:radarm} item, or;
    \item Left-click on the “QDM” \winref{menu:cs} item, or;
    \item Use the keyboard shortcut key combination for a new QDM vector.
\end{itemize}

Then, left-click on the desired start point (radar track or fixed position), and then left-click on the desired end point (radar track or fixed position).

The start point is automatically set to the radar position symbol of the track when starting the vector from the callsign menu

\bigskip

The vector’s data label is located at the end of the line. Its position relative to the line end can be adjusted by middle-clicking the line end or the label itself. The available click spots for a radar track are the radar track position symbol and all its label items that have a TopSky plugin left-click mouse function.

The line end positions will attach to defined points more easily than for a random position (there is a small click area centered on the defined points). The defined points have the following priority order:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Radar track position symbols
    \item VORs in the active sector file
    \item NDBs in the active sector file
    \item Fixes in the active sector file
    \item Airports in the active sector file
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Right-clicking will abort drawing the vector.

\bigskip

To remove a QDM vector:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Right-click on either end point or the midpoint of the line or the label
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

To adjust a QDM vector:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Left-click on either end point. The selected end of the line will attach to the mouse cursor.
    \item Left-click on the new desired end point (radar track or fixed position)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-QDM vector}

When the start point of a QDM vector is a fixed point and the end point a track, the system automatically starts another QDM vector from the same start point. If it is attached to another track, the vectors are grouped together as a multi-QDM, and another vector is again automatically started from the same start point. This happens until the right mouse button is clicked to abort drawing a new vector (or the maximum number of QDM vectors is reached).

\bigskip

The advantage of the multi-QDM vectors is that when hovering over a track label of one of the tracks, a relative distance indication is added to the labels of all other vectors belonging to the same multi-QDM group, showing in parentheses the difference in the distance value compared to the selected track.

\subsection{Scale Marker}
\label{scale}

\winref{menu:radarm} -> Scale Marker

\capdimage{img/scale.png}{Scale Marker}

Displays a range scale in the bottom right corner of the radar screen.

\subsection{Minimum Separation Tool}\label{tool:mst}

The minimum separation tool displays the predicted minimum lateral separation between two radar tracks within the next 30 minutes, assuming both of them maintain their present ground tracks and speeds. Lines are drawn from the tracks’ present positions to the positions where the tracks are predicted to be at the time of the minimum separation.

To draw minimum separation lines between two radar tracks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Left-click on the “SEP” menu item
    \item Left-click on the first radar track
    \item Left-click on the second radar track
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Right-clicking will abort drawing the lines. The available click spots for a radar track are the radar track position symbol and all its label items that have a mouse function.

\bigskip

The minimum separation distance is by default displayed near the end of one of those lines. If the tracks are not converging, the lines will be drawn with an offline-defined length, and the label will display “DIV”.

\bigskip

7 sets of lines can be simultaneously drawn. When at least one set is drawn, a SEP List Window is opened:

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/seplist.png}{SEP List}

The window lists the tracks, the minimum predicted separation, the time to the minimum separation, the line color and a locked/unlocked indicator for each set of lines.
To remove the minimum separation lines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Left-click on the colored box for that set of lines in the SEP List Window
    \item Right-click on a line’s end point
    \item Close the SEP List Window (this removes all minimum separation lines)
\end{itemize}

The lines will be automatically removed if one of the tracks is no longer available, or for unlocked lines, if the tracks start to diverge. If the tracks are diverging at the time the lines are created, they will be automatically locked.

\bigskip

To lock/unlock a set of lines:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Left-click on the box right of the color indicator for that set of lines to toggle the locked/unlocked status. For a locked set of lines, the box will be filled.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

To display vertical separation information on the lines, right-click on the colored box.

Right-clicking on the colored box for a set of lines cycles through:

\begin{longtable}{p{5cm} p{7.5cm}}
  "V"   & Vertical separation display enabled\\
  "v"   & Vertical separation display enabled without the vertical separation labels\\
  blank & Vertical separation display disabled\\
\end{longtable}

When vertical separation display is enabled, on both lines two points are displayed, the first showing the point where the tracks’ vertical separation is calculated to become smaller than an offline-defined value, and the second the point after that where it is calculated to become greater. The calculation is done using the tracks’ current vertical speeds.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The vertical separation labels, when displayed, are similar to the minimum separation label but prefixed with “V”.
    \item If one or both points are beyond the minimum separation point, their calculation is extended forward up to an offline-defined time value.
    \item If a point is already passed or beyond the maximum displayed time, it will not be drawn.
    \item If the end point is beyond the maximum displayed time, a line will be drawn using \colorref{SEP Vert} color from the CPA to the end point or the maximum displayed time whichever is earlier.
    \item If the tracks are not predicted to be separated by less than the defined value within the prediction time, “V=” is displayed left of the minimum separation label.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{View Window}
\label{win:view}
\winref{menu:radarm} -> View...

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/viewmenu.png}{View Window}

The View Window lists the available views. To select a view, left-click on it. The radar screen will be refreshed to show the required area. The first three views, labeled “1”, “2” and “3” are views that can be defined on the fly. To define a view for one of them, set the screen area as desired and then right-click on the number. The number will then change to \colorref{Foreground} color to indicate that it has a view defined for it. An already defined view (“1”, “2” or “3”) can be redefined to show a different screen area just by defining it again with a right-click.

\subsection{Zoom Window}
\label{win:zoom}
\winref{menu:radarm} -> Range XXX

\capdimage{img/zoom.png}{Zoom Window}

\bigskip

The Zoom Window displays and enables to change the radar screen range.

\subsection{Maps Windows}
\label{win:mapsw}

\winref{menu:radarm} -> Maps...

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/mapsmenu.png}{Maps Windows}

The Maps Window closes when the mouse cursor leaves the window area. If this is not desired, there is a hidden click spot in the top right corner of the menu (where the “close” button would be). Left-clicking in that area will disable the automatic closure of the menu and display the close button, which is then used to close the menu.

\bigskip

The Maps Window enables the display of predefined maps on the radar screen, some of which may be set up with automatic activation rules. The maps are arranged to folders. Clicking on a folder name shows the maps in that folder below the folder list.

\bigskip

The map names are displayed with the following colors (automatic options only available for maps with that capability):

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{7.5cm} p{2.5cm}}
    \image{img/mapoff.png}  & Not displayed\\
    \image{img/mapauto.png} & Automatic (not displayed)\\
    \image{img/mapon.png}   & Displayed\\
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

Left-clicking on a map name will change the state of a map one step

not displayed --> automatic (if applicable) --> displayed

\bigskip

Right-clicking in the other direction. Left or right double-clicking on any map name will change the states of all maps in that folder.

\subsection{Track Control Window}
\label{win:tcw}

\winref{menu:radarm} -> Track Control...

\bigskip

The Track Control Window is used to set track and track label related options. Note that the “Vector” selection must be on (see Radar Menu/Shortcut Window) to see the prediction lines. The Track Control Window closes when the mouse cursor leaves the window area. The selections are specific to the radar screen they are made on, but whenever the plugin settings are reloaded either automatically (sign in/out, login callsign change when signed in) or manually the selections on all radar screens will revert to the default values.

\capdimage{img/trackctl.png}{Track Control Window}

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
    Vector          & Sets the length of the prediction line in minutes\\
    History         & Sets the number of history dots\\
    Text            & Changes the track label text size\\
    X Label Fields  & Opens/closes the corresponding Label Fields section\\
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

The Label Fields sections allow controlling the visibility of certain track label fields in the unselected label, and for DAP items, also in the selected label. The visibility can be set depending on the state of the fight plan (\stateref{Coordinated}, \stateref{Assumed}, \stateref{Redundant} or \stateref{Notified}/\stateref{Unconcerned}).

\bigskip

The “All” buttons toggle all the state buttons for that field on/off.

\bigskip

Regardless of the settings here, the necessary label fields will be displayed in certain cases (for example in case of a COPX coordination request, the COPX field will be displayed).


\subsection{Altitude Filtering Window}
\label{win:afw}

\winref{menu:global} -> “Mxxx-yyy” item 

\winref{menu:radarm} -> Altitude Filter [ON/OFF]...

\bigskip

The Altitude Filtering Window is used to filter the displayed track labels based on the aircrafts’ altitudes. It closes when the mouse cursor leaves the window area.

\capdimage{img/altfil.png}{Altitude Filtering Window}

To set the filtering limits, values from -1200ft to FL660 are available with 100ft steps up to 5000ft, then with 500ft steps up to FL660. Select the level and click on the filter on/off button to activate the limit. There are separate on/off buttons for the upper and lower limits, and it is possible to activate either one or both of them. Values at or below the transition altitude are considered to be altitudes (for example with a transition altitude of 5000ft, “050” means 5000ft and “055” means FL55).

\subsection{CJI Filtering Window}
\label{win:cji}

\winref{menu:radarm} -> CJI Filter [ON/OFF]...

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/cji.png}{CJI Filtering Window}

The CJI Filtering Window is used to filter the displayed track labels based on controller ID’s. The window shows the currently online controllers. To filter a controller’s tracks, click on the controller ID in the list. A filtered ID will be shown in inverse video.

\bigskip

The “Uncoup labels” button controls filtering for uncoupled labels (this function is available also in \winref{win:short}).

\bigskip

Clicking “All” filters all controllers, “None” clears all controller ID filters.

\bigskip

The CJI Filtering Window closes when the mouse cursor leaves the window area.

\bigskip

\subsubsection{Primary Track Filtering}\label{func:filterpri}

\winref{win:short} -> “Prim Tracks” button

When enabled, primary track filtering filters out all primary tracks.

\subsubsection{Uncontrolled Flight Filtering}\label{func:filterunc}

\winref{win:short} -> “Uncont Flights” button

When enabled, uncontrolled flight filtering filters out all uncontrolled flights not “On-contact” with you.

\subsection{SSR Code Filtering Window}
\label{win:ssr}

\winref{menu:radarm} -> SSR Filter [ON/OFF]...

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/ssrfil.png}{SSR Code Filtering Window}

The SSR Code Filtering Window is used to filter the displayed track labels based on the aircrafts’ SSR codes. Four different codes or code ranges can be set. The boxes on the left side of the window are the code range start boxes. The input syntax is a valid SSR code to be filtered. If filtering a range of codes is needed, enter the last two digits of the last code in the range to the box on the right. Entering an empty string will clear the box. For example, to filter codes 1400-1427, enter “1400” into one of the four boxes on the left and then “27” into the box next to it. Set the filter on by clicking on the filter on/off button.

\bigskip

All changes to the window must be applied using the buttons in the bottom of the window to take effect.

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
    Ok      & Applies the changes, closes the window\\
    Apply   & Applies the changes\\
    Cancel  & Cancels the changes\\
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Quick Look}
\label{win:qlook}

\winref{menu:radarm} - > “Quick Look” button

\winref{win:short} -> “Quick Look” button 

\winref{func:short}

\bigskip

The Quick Look function can be used to override all filters. It is a toggle function and will stay active until toggled off.

\subsubsection{Individual Quick Look}

Middle-click aircraft position symbol

\bigskip

The Individual Quick Look function can be used to override the CJI filter for a specific track and to display labels for uncoupled primary tracks which are normally automatically hidden. It is a toggle function, middle-clicking again will hide the labels again.

\subsection{Level Band Highlight}\label{func:lbh}

Right click AFL track label item 

\bigskip

While active, this function highlights the callsigns of the referenced flight and the callsigns of all other flights within the level band of the referenced flight. The prediction line is forced on for these flights.

\bigskip

All other flights will be filtered out to display just their track position symbols and history dots unless they have an active STCA, APW, MSAW or AIW warning or are squawking 7500, 7600 or 7700. Tracks without a valid AFL will be filtered out.

\subsection{Oceanic Level highlight}\label{func:olh}

Right click OFL track label item 

\bigskip

While active, this function highlights the callsigns of the referenced flight and the callsigns of all other flights having the same OAN and OFL. The prediction line is forced on for these flights.

\bigskip

All other flights will be filtered out to display just their track position symbols and history dots unless they have an active STCA, APW, MSAW or AIW warning or are squawking 7500, 7600 or 7700.

\capdimage{img/dlsetup.png}{CPDLC Setting Window}

The CPDLC Setting Window is used to begin/end the connection to the CPDLC network, and change some CPDLC related settings. It is split into three sections:

\subsubsection*{Connection setup}

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
  Login               & Four-character callsign used for the CPDLC connection\\
  “Connect”/“Online”  & Left-click to Connect/disconnect the plugin to/from the CPDLC network\\
  Logon               & Code Your personal password to the Hoppie network\\
\end{longtable}

Once a connection has been established, the “Connect” button background color changes to \colorref{Information} and the button text changes to “Online”.

\note{ It is possible to have the Logon Code pre-filled by creating a text file named \texttt{TopSkyCPDLChoppieCode.txt} in the same folder as the plugin dll (\texttt{TopSky.dll}). The file should contain only the logon code, nothing else. As the file contains your personal logon code, do not share it.}

If the VATSIM callsign is known when the window is opened, the CPDLC login callsign is pre-selected based on it. If necessary, the CPDLC login can be changed.

\subsubsection*{DCL/PDC setup}\label{win:dlsdcl}

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
  DCL/PDC & Datalink clearance service on/off\\
  Auto    & Automatic sending of datalink clearances on/off\\
\end{longtable}

\note{The DFREQ, NFREQ, NPT and START options have no effect, as they are not used in the CLD message.}

When the “Auto” option is enabled, a datalink clearance will be automatically sent when a request is received if all the following conditions are met:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The received clearance request must not contain any remarks text;\\
  \item A suitable clearance format is available for the aircraft;\\
  \item The aircraft is not assumed by another controller;\\
  \item The aircraft has a departure runway assigned;\\
  \item The aircraft has a cleared altitude manually assigned;\\
  \item The aircraft has a transponder code assigned.\\
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{CPDLC setup}

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
  CPDLC               & CPDLC service on/off\\
  Auto-accept logon   & Automatically accepts valid logon requests from tracks above FL100\\
\end{longtable}

The following items are the only ones visible also in proxy EuroScope instances, and are used to determine whether sending a clearance via CPDLC is the default setting in some of the plugin menus. For this to happen:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The aircraft must be above FL100;
  \item The selection button for the menu in question must be on;
  \item The CPDLC Default Status (in \winref{menu:global}->\winref{menu:sts}) must be “ON".
\end{itemize}

When making changes to any items other than the connection setup part and the “DCL/PDC” and “CPDLC” selections, the “Ok” and “Cancel” buttons become active. Left-click on “Ok” to apply the changes or “Cancel” to abort.

\subsection{Raw Video Control Window}
\label{win:rvcw}

\winref{menu:global} Setup -> Raw Video Control...

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/rawvideo.png}{Raw Video Control Window}

The Raw Video Control Window closes when the mouse cursor leaves the window area.

\bigskip

The Raw Video Control Window controls the brightness (in general) and afterglow (how fast the radar returns fade) of the raw video radar data.

\subsection{Airspace Management Window}
\label{win:amw}

\winref{menu:global} AMS -> TSA...

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/tsa.png}{Airspace Management Window}

This window is used to control the activation of the areas for the APW and SAP functionality. Each area can have start/end times and/or an end time defined for its activation, or it can be activated without any time limits, making it active until deactivated manually. The areas can also have lower and/or upper altitude limits. An area can have activation rules defined in the area data file. Such areas will be automatically activated based on schedule data, NOTAM or AUP contents as long as their “Auto” option is selected ( “A” in the “Auto” column). The “Auto” option cannot be selected for areas with no activation rules.

\bigskip

An area’s activation status can be inactive, pre-active or active. A pre-active area is an area that will become active within 30 minutes and is shown in \colorref{Selected Period} text on a \colorref{TSA Preactive} background. An active area is shown with \colorref{Selected Period} text on a \colorref{TSA Active} background. The APW system will not alert for a pre-active area, but the SAP system will.

\bigskip

When the cursor is over the window area, the bottom message area displays automatic map activation options depending on the setup. Each one is colored \colorref{Arm} if selected off, \colorref{Warning} if on but no data available, and \colorref{Foreground} if on and data available. When the remote option is active, changes to area parameters are not allowed. AUP and NOTAM activation can be selected on/off but the data may be overridden depending on how the remote data source has been set up

\bigskip

The mouse click areas of the Airspace Management Window:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
  Sorting option text (e.g. “Start date/time”)  & Opens a pop-up menu to select a sorting option for the list\\

  “Master” label                                & Toggles saving/uploading area activation data\\
\end{longtable}

The sorting pop-up menu contains the following items:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
  Start Date/Time   & Sorts based on the Start Date/Time, earliest first\\
  Name              & Sorts alphabetically based on the Name field\\
  Map Text          & Sorts alphabetically based on the Map Text field \\
\end{longtable}

The area pop-up menu contains the following items:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
  Activate    & Clears any activation times and activates the area\\
  Deactivate  & Clears any activation times and deactivates the area\\
  Auto        & If an activation schedule is found in the area data file, sets the area to be activated automatically\\
  Edit        & Allows to change the area parameters\\
  Full Edit   & Not implemented\\
  Copy        & Not implemented\\
  Delete      & Clears any activation times, returns label and altitude limits to their default values and deactivates the area\\
\end{longtable}

With the area pop-up menu opened, the area text row background changes to “Flight Highlight” color. 

\bigskip

With the “Edit” function activated, the following mouse click areas are available for the edited area:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
  Map Text    & Set/change/delete the area label text\\
  Start Date  & Set/change/delete the start date\\
  Start Time  & Set/change/delete the start time\\
  End Date    & Set/change/delete the end date\\
  End Time    & Set/change/delete the end time\\

  Upper       & Set/change/delete the upper altitude limit\\
  User        & Set/change/delete a user defined text\\
\end{longtable}

Dates are shown in the format “yymmdd” and times in “hh:mm” and they must be entered in the same format. Entering an empty string for a date will clear it and the related time value and vice versa. When entering a time or date value to an empty field, the other value is automatically set to the current time/date value. Entering an empty string to the Map Text, Lower or Upper fields will reset the value to the default one from the data file.

\bigskip

Altitudes are shown in hundreds of feet if at or below the transition altitude, otherwise in flight levels.

\bigskip

After any selection from the pop-up menu other than “Edit”, “Ok”, “Apply” or “Cancel” must be selected to apply or cancel the selection. 

\subsubsection{Area display}

Preactive and active areas are displayed on the radar screen. A preactive area border is drawn in \colorref{Preactive Map}. An active area border is drawn in \colorref{Active Map Type 4} border and, for areas with high operational impact, filled in a transparent \colorref{Active RD Infill Map}. 

\capdimage{img/tsapre.png}{Preactive Area} \capdimage{img/tsaact.png}{Active Area} \capdimage{img/tsafill.png}{Active High Operational Impact Area}

\subsubsection{Area label}

An area may display a predefined reduced text label, showing information about the area. By holding the left mouse button down on MAPTEXT or UPPER/LOWER, a full area label will be displayed, showing:

\begin{center}
  NAME\\
  MAPTEXT\\
  UPPER USERTEXT \\
  --------- START TIME - END TIME\\
  LOWER\\
\end{center}

The reduced label can be configured to display any combination of these fields. In the reduced label, a lower limit of “000” will not be displayed.

\bigskip

If an area has more than one activation period defined, is currently active, and the next activation period is pre-active, the levels, times and user text for the next activation period are shown below the current activation period in the label.

\end{longtable}

\bigskip

In TopSky the only difference between an APL and an FPL is that an APL can only contain the Callsign. If it contains any other information (controller-assigned values such as ASSR, CFL, etc. are not taken into account), it will be considered to be an FPL.

\bigskip

For the accepted CFL entry formats, see \winref{menu:afl}.

\subsection{Complete Route Window}
\label{win:crw}

Flight Plan Window -> “RTE” button

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/route.png}{Complete Route Window}

Displays the expanded route of the FPL currently shown in the \winref{win:fpw}. Already passed points are shown with \colorref{Overflown} color background. Points still ahead show the estimated time over the point and the calculated flight level below the point name.

\subsection{Create APL Window}
\label{win:apl}

\winref{menu:cs} (uncorrelated track only) -> “Create APL” item

\capdimage{img/apl2.png}{Create APL Window}

\bigskip

The bottom area of the window will show status and error messages.

\bigskip

Enter all the available information (the only required field is the callsign) and click “Ok” to create the APL. “Cancel” will clear all the fields.

\bigskip

If the SSR field is left empty, a code will be automatically assigned from a dedicated APL code range. If no codes are available, an error message will be shown and a code must be manually entered.

\bigskip

For the accepted CFL entry formats, see \winref{menu:afl}.

\bigskip

Left-clicking on the FRUL field toggles the flight rules between “I” (IFR) and “V” (VFR).
When the APL is successfully created, it is automatically assumed.

\subsection{Stack Manager Window}
\label{win:smw}
Holding List... -> “HPT” item

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/stackman.png}{Stack Manager Window}

The Stack Manager Windows give a quick look into the vertical positions of aircraft that have been given a holding clearance to the holding fix associated with the window in question.

\bigskip

The window is split into three columns:

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
    Approaching Hold:   & Aircraft approaching the holding area
    
                          (more than 5 minutes flying time away from the holding fix)\\
    Hold:               & Aircraft in the holding area\\
    Leave Hold:         & Aircraft cleared to leave the holding\\   
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

The window displays the aircraft labels at their cleared flight levels. For each aircraft the callsign, the vertical speed arrow if not in level flight (“\#” in \colorref{Warning} color for aircraft without altitude information), the RVSM capability indicator if applicable, and the \tagref{tag:CFL} is displayed. If there are more than one aircraft with the same \tagref{tag:CFL}, only one callsign will be shown. A “+” symbol in \colorref{SMW Overlap Box} color after the \tagref{tag:CFL} value indicates that there are more flights to be displayed. Clicking on the symbol will display a window with all the callsigns with that \tagref{tag:CFL}.

\bigskip

For each aircraft an altitude box will be drawn that extends from \tagref{tag:AFL} to \tagref{tag:CFL}. Normally the color of the box is \colorref{SMW Level Band}, but in the Hold and Leave Hold columns if it is closer than 300ft or overlaps any other aircraft’s box, the color will be \colorref{SMW Overlap}. For an aircraft with a CLAM alert, the box will be in \colorref{SMW Overshoot} color. A flight level reserved for an overflight is shown in \colorref{SMW Overflight} color. The altitude box of aircraft in the Leave Hold column extends into the Hold column as well.

\warn{If two Hold volumes overlap (such as PILIM and ABUSU), each Stack Manager Window will show only it's own traffic, the adjacent interfering traffic will not be displayed}

\bigskip

Aircraft will be automatically removed from the Leave Hold column after 10 minutes, but they can also be manually removed by right-clicking the callsign.

\bigskip

Any number of Stack Manager Windows can be opened to monitor multiple holdings at the same time. For \tagref{tag:CFL} at or below the transition altitude, the aircraft label is placed on the numerical value of the \tagref{tag:CFL}, but the altitude box is always based on flight levels.

\bigskip

The mouse click areas of the Stack Manager Window:

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{5.5cm} p{7cm}}
    Slider or view background area  & Drag to adjust the lowest shown FL\\
    Aircraft callsigns              & Open \winref{menu:cs} \footnotemark[1]\\
    CFL                             & Open \winref{menu:cfl} \footnotemark[2]\\
    + symbol                        & Open window to view all callsigns with that \tagref{tag:CFL}\\
    FL numbers                      & Toggle overflight status for that level\\   
\end{longtable}

\footnotetext[1]{Right-clicking a callsign in the Leave Hold column immediately removes the aircraft from display.}
\footnotetext[2]{When opened from a Stack Manager Window, the default value in the CFL menu is the current CFL regardless of the setting in the \winref{menu:localset}.}

\subsection{CARD}
\label{win:card}

\winref{menu:global} Tools -> CARD..

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/card.png}{CARD}

See \winref{tool:MTCD}. The CARD window presents the MTCD conflicts and conflict risks. It also allows setting some of the related parameters. It is divided into two parts:

\bigskip

On the left is the list area which includes all the detected conflicts and shows the concerned aircrafts’ callsigns. The conflict label background is in \colorref{Urgency} color for a conflict or potential predicted conflict, \colorref{Warning} for a risk or potential risk of conflict and \colorref{Conflict Ack} for an acknowledged conflict. An acknowledged conflict will be automatically de-acknowledged if the predicted minimum separation decreases by 1nm.

\bigskip

On the right is the graphical display area that gives an overview to the severity and timeframe for each conflict. On the vertical (distance) axis the conflicts are placed to the predicted minimum separation and on the horizontal (time) axis the label is placed so that the left edge of the conflict number is at the time of closest point of approach. A line in \colorref{CARD Time Vector} color, extending to the left from the label, marks the time when the separation will decrease below the prediction distance. For fast closure rates the time from prediction distance to CPA may be too short to display the line. The conflict labels have the same mouse functions as the ones in the list area. If the label position would be outside the maximum time displayed in the window, the label is positioned at the maximum displayed time. The area below 5nm distance is drawn in \colorref{CARD Min Sep} color.

\bigskip

The mouse click areas of the CARD window:

\subsection{Microphone Check Menu}
\label{menu:dlmcm}

\winref{menu:global} Tools -> CPDLC -> Microphone Check

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/dlmicchk.png}{Microphone Check Menu}

The Microphone Check menu is used to send a “CHECK STUCK MICROPHONE <frequency>” CPDLC message to all CPDLC connected aircraft when a stuck mic is suspected. The menu lists all frequencies selected for XMT TXT in EuroScope. Left-clicking on one sends the messages. Manual frequency entry is not available.

\bigskip

The menu closes when a frequency is selected or the cursor leaves the menu area.

\subsection{CPDLC Current Message Window}
\label{win:dlcmw}

\winref{menu:global} Tools -> CPDLC -> Current Messages...

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/dlcmw.png}{CPDLC Current Message Window}

The \winref{win:dlcmw} displays all sent and received CPDLC messages that have not been archived. Each line corresponds to one message, and contains the time the message was sent/received, the callsign of the aircraft, a filled triangle (pointing upward for uplink messages, downward for downlink messages) and the message text. If the message is too long to fit in the window, “…” is used to mark that there is more text in the message. Right-clicking on the message will open a small window that displays the entire message. The window will close automatically when the mouse cursor leaves its area.

\bigskip

The messages (for uplink clearances, also the responses) are color coded to display their status:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \colorref{Urgency} for CPDLC emergency messages that have not been replied to
    \item \colorref{CPDLC Failed} for failed uplink messages
    \item \colorref{CPDLC Unable} for uplink clearances replied to with “UNABLE”
    \item \colorref{CPDLC Standby} for uplink clearances replied to with “STANDBY”, and not timed out
    \item \colorref{CPDLC UM Clearance} for uplink clearances waiting for reply, and not timed out
    \item \colorref{CPDLC Pilot Late} for timed out uplink clearances
    \item \colorref{CPDLC Discarded} for discarded messages
    \item \colorref{CPDLC DM Request} for downlink requests waiting for controller reply, and not timed out
    \item \colorref{CPDLC Controller Late} for timed out downlink requests
    \item \colorref{Foreground} for other messages
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Left-clicking on the current sorting option opens a popup to select the sorting order:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
    TIME/CS     & Messages sorted according to send/receive time (default option)\\
    DIALOG/CS   & Messages grouped to dialogues, dialogues sorted by time of first message\\
    CS/DIALOG   & Messages sorted by callsign, messages with same callsign sorted by time\\
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

Left-clicking on a message opens a popup to select some actions for the message:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
    Archive & Closes the message dialogue if open, archives all messages in that dialogue\\
    Discard & Closes the message dialogue and discards all the messages in it\\
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

If the message is “REQUEST LOGON”:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
    ACCEPT & Accepts the logon request\\
    UNABLE & Denies the logon request\\
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

For other messages:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
    Manual & Reply Opens \winref{win:dlmrw}\\
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

Dialogues are never archived automatically, so make sure to manually archive dialogues when they are no longer relevant to keep the window from getting cluttered with messages.

\bigskip

Always reply to downlink requests using the relevant menu as it ensures correct formatting and type of message, and keeps the track label indications correct. The reply options here should only be used when a menu cannot be used, for example when the downlink was not parsed correctly and the request is therefore not shown on the track label.

\subsection{Manual Reply Window}
\label{win:dlmrw}

This window is used to send a manually composed reply to a CPDLC message (max 99 characters). Left-click on the area below the “Message text” label to enter the message and select one of the “Expected reply” options. Then left-click on “Send” to send the message.

\bigskip

The window closes automatically when the message is sent or the mouse cursor leaves the window area.

\warn{  When replying to a downlink request using the Manual Reply Window, the track label is not updated accordingly. If the downlink had been recognized as a request, the request information is removed from the label, and if the reply is a clearance, it is not shown on the label, and the label values are not updated. Always use the label menus to answer a recognized downlink}

The Weather Messages Window displays weather related messages. By default, METAR/SPECI messages are shown. To view other types of messages, left-click on the desired option button (the “LLF” and “AIREP” options are not available).

\bigskip

By default, with the “METAR/SPECI” option button chosen, this window displays the METARs you have requested to TopSky. Whenever a new METAR is received from the server it is added to the list (an old METAR is removed when a newer one is received from the same station). New METARs and TAFs are displayed in \colorref{Warning} color until the mouse cursor is positioned on them (for the decoded METAR, this applies only for the first row).

\bigskip

In addition, the window can display SIGMETs, SNOWTAMs and TAFs. The SIGMETs are retrieved when the “SIGMET” button is selected for the first time. Selecting the “SNOWTAM” or “TAF” option will open the \winref{menu:ad} where the desired stations must be selected. Messages are automatically updated at 15 minute intervals - the status bar at the bottom displays the remaining time to the next automatic update when the mouse cursor is over the window area.

\bigskip

The messages are sorted alphabetically by the station identifier in the list.

\bigskip

The messages can be viewed in three modes (decoded only available for METARs):

\begin{itemize}
    \item List (the default mode, showing one message per line)
    \item Single (showing only a single message)
    \item Single decoded (showing a single METAR in a decoded format)
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

To view a single message:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Left-click on a METAR/SIGMET/SNOWTAM/TAF in the list
    \item Left-click on a decoded METAR
\end{itemize}

Acceptable entries are locations defined in the active sector file and lat/lon positions in whole degrees (either in the flight plan format or ARINC424 shorthand, i.e. “60N025E” or “6025E”).

\bigskip

The “Updated at HH:MM” displays the timestamp of the data downloaded by the plugin (the data itself is the forecast for 6 hours after that time). If no time is shown, then no data is available.

\subsection{Airfield Data Window}\label{win:adw}

\winref{menu:global} MET -> Airfield Data

\capdimage{img/adw.png}{Airfield Data Window}

The window displays the QNH values, transition levels and other information for those airports that have a METAR displayed in the \winref{win:wxmw}. The transition level tables are defined in a data file, and if a table can’t be found for an airport in the list, a transition level will not be shown. The buttons in the window have no functionality.

\bigskip

The following information is displayed:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}

Holding a mouse button down on a message will display the entire message.

\subsection{NAT Track Messages Window}
\label{win:nattmw}

\winref{menu:global} MSG -> NAT Track Messages...

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/nat.png}{NAT Track Messages Window}

The NAT Track Messages Window displays the downloaded track messages. The messages are downloaded when the window is opened the first time and then updated hourly. The tracks extracted from the messages can be displayed on the radar screen – they are placed to a “NAT” folder in the \winref{win:mapsw}. Any named waypoints in the tracks that cannot be found in the active sector file are just skipped so the displayed tracks may not be accurate. The track letter is added to the name of the first and last waypoints in parentheses, so a missing track letter is a sure sign of at least some waypoints missing.

\subsection{Safety Nets Status Window}
\label{win:snsw}

\winref{menu:global} STS -> Safety Nets Status...

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/snets.png}{Safety Nets Status Window}

Allows setting the status for the \winref{tool:STCA}, \winref{tool:MSAW}, \winref{tool:APW} and \winref{tool:AIW} systems. The “On/Off” buttons control the corresponding system’s status.

\bigskip

Below them, there are four entry boxes for callsigns to exclude specific callsigns from all the safety nets. The “*” wildcard can be used to match multiple callsigns. It causes all the callsigns that match up to the “*” to be a match (i.e. “ABC*” will match all callsigns that start with “ABC”, but “*ABC” will match all callsigns as any characters after the “*” will be ignored).

\bigskip

Below the callsign fields, there are four SSR code boxes that can be used to exclude specific SSR codes from all the safety nets. The entered values must be 1-4 octal digits, and the system will match the number of digits entered (i.e. “2000” will match only code 2000, whereas “20” will match all codes in the range 2000-2077).

\bigskip

If there are STCA inhibition areas defined in the area data file, they will be listed in the area in the bottom part of the window. The area vertical limits (displayed in 100’s of feet or meters+“m” depending on system units) can be edited by clicking on the values, and the area activation can be toggled by clicking on the area status.

\bigskip

All changes to the window must be applied using the buttons in the bottom of the window to take effect.

MTCD inhibition areas will be listed in the area below the “On/Off” button. The area activation can be toggled by clicking on the area status.

\bigskip

The rest of the inhibition settings affect both \winref{tool:MTCD} and \winref{tool:SAP} systems:

\bigskip

Below the inhibit areas, there are four SSR code boxes that can be used to exclude specific SSR codes from MTCD/SAP processing. The entered values must be 1-2 octal digits, and the system will match the number of digits entered (i.e. “2” will match codes 2000-2777, whereas “20” will match codes 2000-2077).

\bigskip

Below the SSR codes, there are four ATYP boxes to exclude specific aircraft types. The entered text strings must be exact ICAO aircraft type designators (no partial matches or wildcards).

\bigskip

The flight type inhibit is not available due to network restrictions.

\bigskip

VFR or IFR flights can be excluded by selecting the respective “Inhibited Flight Rules” button to “On”.

\bigskip

Finally, there are four entry boxes to exclude specific callsigns. The “*” wildcard can be used to match multiple callsigns. It causes all the callsigns that match up to the “*” to be a match (i.e. “ABC*” will match all callsigns that start with “ABC”, but “*ABC” will match all callsigns as any characters after the “*” will be ignored).

\bigskip

All changes to the window must be applied using the buttons in the bottom of the window to take effect.

The window will open below the mouse cursor, or will be repositioned there if already open. 

\bigskip

The window contains selection buttons to toggle the display of the approach lines for the airport’s runways, and a listing of the currently active runways. The “ARR RWL DISPLAY” option toggles the automatic display of all approach lines for runways that are selected active for arrival. The setting is global for all airports.

\bigskip

The options, and their default settings for the approach lines are as follows:

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
  OFF & No line drawn\\
  NM  & 16nm line, 5 markers at 2nm intervals\\
  NME & 30nm line, 5 markers at 2nm intervals, then 4 markers at 5nm intervals\\
  Km  & 30km line, 5 markers at 2km intervals, then 4 markers at 5km intervals\\
\end{longtable}

The color of the line is different depending on whether the runway is active for arrivals or not.

\subsection{Operations Rate Window}
\label{win:orw}

\bigskip

\capdimage{img/opsrate.png}{Runway in Use Window}

The Operations Rate Window displays the predicted hourly operations rate at a specified airport. The data is displayed in 5-minute steps and shown up to 5 hours into the future. The arrival prediction is based on aircraft tracks as calculated by EuroScope. The departures are predicted to depart immediately if their ground status is set to “DEPA”, earliest in 5 minutes if “TAXI” and earliest in 10 minutes if “PUSH”, with a maximum departure rate of one aircraft per minute.

\bigskip

A number of these windows can be opened to simultaneously view multiple combinations of airport, departure/arrival state and runway(s).

\bigskip

In the area below the title bar, on the left is the ICAO identifier of the airport whose traffic is being monitored (a gray label “ICAO” is shown if no airport is selected yet).

\bigskip

The “Dep” and “Arr” buttons control whether departures and/or arrivals should be shown on the display (button background is shown in \colorref{Selected} color if selected on).

\bigskip

The “RWY” label allows entering one or more runway identifiers to filter traffic based on the assigned runway.

\bigskip

The numbers on the right side are the caution and warning limits. The rates are color coded so that a rate at or below the caution limit will be shown in \colorref{COL Under Threshold} color, a rate above that but at or below the warning limit in \colorref{COL Above Threshold} and a rate above that in \colorref{Urgency}. When both arrivals and departures are selected for display, the departures are shown with a hatched color.

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
    ICAO        & Enter airport identifier\\
    Dep         & Toggle departures on/off\\
    Arr         & Toggle arrivals on/off\\

\end{longtable}

\subsection{Predicted Traffic Window}
\label{win:ptw}

\winref{menu:global} STS -> Supervisory -> Predicted Traffic...

\bigskip

The Predicted Traffic Window shows the number of aircraft that are predicted to be inside a specified controller’s airspace. The data is displayed in 5-minute steps and shown up to 5 hours into the future. The prediction is based on the sector ownership and the aircraft tracks are as calculated by EuroScope.

\bigskip

A number of these windows can be opened to simultaneously view multiple controllers’ situation. In the area below the title bar, the left side shows the controller ID whose traffic is being monitored (a gray label “ID” is shown if no controller ID is selected yet). Left-click on the text to enter a new ID. If the monitored ID is your own, the data area background will be in “Active Sector” color, otherwise in \colorref{Inactive Sector}.

\bigskip

The numbers on the right side are the caution and warning limits. To change them, left-click on them and re-enter in the same format (warning can’t be lower than caution, numbers must be separated by a forward slash). The traffic numbers are color coded so that a number at or below the caution limit will be shown in \colorref{COL Under Threshold} color, a number above that but at or below the warning limit in \colorref{COL Above Threshold} and a number above that in \colorref{Urgency}.

\bigskip

The two sliders change the traffic number and time scales.

\subsection{Air Traffic Flow Management Window}\label{win:atfmw}

  R/T     & Sends a “REVERT TO VOICE” message, aborts the datalink clearance process\\
  Cancel  & Closes the window\\
\end{longtable}

The “Send MSG” button is available when a clearance can be sent – a defined format is available, all required fields have been filled (all fields marked with “*” above, when present, are required fields) and another controller is not tracking the aircraft (so it’s possible to set the clearance flag).

\subsection{Oceanic Time Restriction Window}\label{win:otrw}

“Open Oceanic Time Restriction Window” label function

\capdimage{img/otrw.png}{Oceanic Time Restriction Window}

The Oceanic Time Restriction Window displays the time restriction(s) contained in the OCM. The window closes when the cursor leaves the window area.

\section{Flight Leg}

The Flight Leg displays the aircraft’s planned track in one-minute steps. Each one-minute-long part of the
path is colored according to the results of the \winref{tool:MTCD} and \winref{tool:SAP} processing. The following colors are possible:

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
\colorref{Urgency FL}      & MTCD conflict or potential predicted conflict, SAP conflic\\
\colorref{Warning FL}      & MTCD risk, SAP risk\\
\colorref{Potential FL}    & MTCD potential risk\\
\colorref{Conflict Ack FL} & MTCD acknowledged conflict\\
\colorref{Information FL}  & MTCD and/or SAP processing available, no conflicts or risks detected\\
\colorref{Flight Leg}      & No MTCD or SAP processing available for this part of the Flight Leg\\
\end{longtable}

\bigskip

If the aircraft has an assigned heading or is not following its route, the predictions only go up to 10 minutes
and assume the aircraft continues on its present ground track. In this case the predicted track is shown as a
dashed line when the flight leg is displayed.

\bigskip

The Flight Leg is displayed by clicking on various track label and list items depending on the setup and is
either automatically removed from display when the mouse cursor leaves the label area or must be
manually toggled off, depending on the function that was used to display it.

\bigskip

The Flight Leg line is one pixel thick, except when it is showing only SAP conflicts (opened from the SAP Window) or showing also MTCD information (any conflicting aircraft legs). In that case the FLEG for the referenced flight is three pixels thick and the possible other FLEGs one pixel thick.

\bigskip

The label that’s shown on each route point includes the following predefined fields:

\bigskip

\begin{longtable}{p{2.5cm} p{10cm}}
\image{img/fleto.png}     & Estimated Time Over the point\\
\image{img/fltoc.png}   & Top of Climb\\
\image{img/fltod.png}   & Top of Descent\\
\end{longtable}

\section{Airport and area hotspots block screen panning}

If you happen to drag one of the airport or area hotspot symbols when trying to move the screen, the screen will not move.

\section{ROF/RTI/TIP message availability limited}

As there is no real plugin-to-plugin communication available, the availability and success of sending the ROF, RTI and TIP messages is somewhat limited.

\section{Problems opening the Radar Menu}

The default method of opening the Radar Menu (<ALT>+right-click) may not always work on Mac hardware. It’s possible to adjust TopSky settings to try another combination, but the easiest way is to insert the following line to the TopSkySettingsLocal.txt file:

\verb|Shortcut\RadarMenu\Combo=0x00|

The Radar Menu is then opened by right-clicking anywhere on the Global Menu.
