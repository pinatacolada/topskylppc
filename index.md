1   Download and install EuroScope from https://www.euroscope.hu/install/EuroScopeSetup32.msi. By default EuroScope will ask to install in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\EuroScope'. Remember where your installation directory is as it will be used a lot. It is strongly recommended not to change the installation directory.

2   Download EuroScope Beta r34 from https://www.euroscope.hu/install/EuroScopeBeta32a34.zip

3   Browse to your install directory and unzip the contents of the beta on top of your Euroscope installation. Overwrite the existing files. 

4   In your install directory, right click the 'EuroScope.exe' file, and access 'Properties'.
